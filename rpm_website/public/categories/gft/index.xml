      <title>The End (2024) - 149 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like EMILIA PÉREZ, THE END is a musical with, at first glance, no reason to be a musical as well as songs that aren’t particularly memorable. Unlike EMILIA PÉREZ, THE END winds up justifying its unusual genre choice. The stylisation and excess of the musical genre ends up contrasting with and emphasising the emotional repression at the core of the film.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Harvest (2024) - 133 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HARVEST is a period drama with the trappings of a folk horror and does not succeed as either. There’s no horror and the drama does not represent any particular period. It obliquely refers to the Highland Clearances without actually being embedded in the Scottish context of those events. HARVEST is an hour too long at the front and is poorly paced throughout, the characters are tediously obtuse, and the script loves to tell rather than show.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sharp Corner (2024) - 110 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An astonishing physical performance from Ben Foster drives this thriller where the villain is not a serial killer but road infrastructure and careless rural driving practices. Ben Foster is a charming, creepy, unreadable quiet little man whose obsession drives away his hot wife (played by Cobie Smulders who manages to do enough with the very little character that the screenplay gives). Foster’s secret seems to be bringing a little Tim Robinson energy to the role in a way that makes the script pop while also tapping into the deep pathos of the character and further establishes &lt;em&gt;I Think You Should Leave&lt;/em&gt; as the key text of our current sociocultural moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s something extra tense about a thriller that could be resolved instantly if the character just did something – anything – different: in this case if Nicolas Cage’s nameless protagonist just left the beach car park where he spends the entire film. Fortunately he doesn’t and director Lorcan Finnegan gives us a trippy take on the classic Cage performance, emphasising the deep psychological distress of this character and his one-man war of attrition against some mean Australians. A wildly entertaining film that portrays the stifling and oppressive atmosphere of a dry heat and the bizarre madness that it induces uncomfortably well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tornado (2025) - 100 mins</title>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/tornado/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The howling of the wind around walls and through trees dominates the soundscape of the film’s first half, subtly suggesting the Scottish landscape itself turning against Tornado (Kōki,). However the wind dies down in the second half as Tornado herself takes on the force of the wind and becomes the avenging samurai that the land needs. TORNADO has an incredible sense of place, embedded in the Scottish hills where the film was shot. The space is clearly articulated in the film such that we always have a sense of the geography of the lake around which the story takes place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hoard (2023) - 126 mins</title>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/hoard/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a film about hoarding and collecting excess, it’s almost appropriate how much cruft there is in HOARD that could have been edited out and pared down. This could have been a much tighter film about the looming spectre of family mental illness and how love and sexual awakening brings these chaotic demons to the surface. The central idea of the “catalogue of love” is heartbreaking in its tenderness and its grotesque implications and the film needed to be streamlined for that emotional throughline. Both Saura Lightfoot Leon and Lily-Beau Leach are terrific as Maria, bringing the strange poetry of her illness to life in a way that’s as beautiful as it is disturbing. HOARD just needed less of the excess around that central emotional structure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A pandemic sci-fi thriller that might be too much for those exhausted by the last few years but that offers an eerie atmosphere and some interesting twists and turns. Sometimes it’s hard to tell if I get frustrated by clumsy tropes because I’ve watched too many films or if it’s an unfortunate element of the script. Either way it’s a shame that this starts so promisingly and descends into a third act of genre tropes, most egregiously the computer that auto-plays the most narratively pertinent recordings when it turns on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>La chimera (2023) - 133 mins</title>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/la_chimera/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LA CHIMERA has an odd tempo, like a half-remembered story from long ago that becomes clearer when there’s a little rhyme to help you along. Arthur (Josh O’Connor) is a rogue archaeologist, robbing graves and raiding Etruscan tombs. His quasi-mystic gift for finding lost things through a weird dowsing ritual gives the film a mythic quality, rich with allegory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lousy Carter (David Krumholtz) is dying and Bob Byington’s film invites us to ask, who cares? On paper, he’s an unlikeable American literature professor, a narcissist with few friends who halfheartedly pursues a relationship with a student. But David Krumholtz brings him to life with a genuine humanism and dry charm. It’s a comedy that is wonderfully ambivalent about its own existence with the ultimate joke being that, despite openly hating itself, an audience can watch it and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Love Lies Bleeding (2024) - 104 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last two seconds of SAINT MAUD prove Rose Glass is a visceral filmmaker and that’s on full aural and visual display in LOVE LIES BLEEDING: we hear the sounds of muscles stretching and throats constricting; we see jawbones breaking and blood spatter squelching. This visceral cinematic expression is in service of a modern-day THELMA AND LOUISE where queerness isn’t the backbone of the narrative but just one element of this love and revenge story. In different ways, Lou (Kristen Stewart) and Jackie (Katy O’Brian) both learn to embrace the metaphorical monsters that society has turned them into and use that self-knowledge for liberation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s fun to imagine the screening for Studio Ghibli executives and creative staff where they realised that Miyazaki Hayao’s ‘last’ film involves an ageing wizard who allows the world he’s created to crumble because he can’t find a worthy successor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What stands out in David Lowery’s telling of &lt;em&gt;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&lt;/em&gt; is the film’s poetic depiction of a land perched between paganism and Christianity, in that boundary space between competing ways of life: a solstice of cultures, a time—like Christmas—when the barriers between worlds are made thin. The pagan forces of nature and the kingdoms of Christendom are at war throughout the film, fighting over a land that is already saturated with the red bloodshed of centuries. And what’s it all for? In the end, even as he dreams of running from his own mortality, Gawain (Dev Patel) discovers that he’s already rotting from the inside out. The green that The Lady (Alicia Vikander) tells us will take everything already took him and his kingdom long ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A thoroughly charming found-family Christmas anime which mines comedy from some very tragic scenes and finds a delightful balance between those tragicomic elements. The film excels at weaving a twisting narrative but never feeling tangled. Some aspects of the portrayal of queerness through the character of Hana (Umegaki Yoshiaki) feel regressive in 2023 and through my particular cultural lens as a white Anglo critic but on the whole it feels like Kon Satoshi had his heart in the right place with it particularly as the characters deepen and reveal themselves throughout the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As in M. R. James’ ghost stories, Joanna Hogg shows how memories gradually accrete in places—rooms, landscapes, countries—until those spaces buckle under the weight of meaning and become haunted by the past. When you return to these places, time slips out of joint and it’s not clear how many days or years pass in the same place or even when you are. You’re left haunted by the ghosts of feelings: an uncomfortable conversation, an awkward misunderstanding, a yearning to make another person happy in a way you never can, the slow-dripping sorrow of emotionally repressed Englishness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Killers of the Flower Moon (2023) - 206 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Deserter in &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt; talks about “[t]he mask of humanity fall[ing] from capital. It has to take it off to kill everyone—everything you love; all the hope and tenderness in the world. It has to take it off, just for one second. To do the deed.” The horror in KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is how little the mask slips even as Osage people are murdered and brutalised. Black Wall Street and the KKK are backgrounded and instead the film is driven by the percussive bass beat of a more insidious form of racism: Hale (Robert De Niro) and Ernest (Leonardo DiCaprio) don’t hate the Osage—they learn their culture and their language—but they never view the Osage as people. Through their eyes, Osage are not capitalist subjects worthy of wealth but objects standing in the way of the money they view as their birthright as white men. Then in the film’s closing scenes, Scorsese turns the camera around to expose his own complicity and the film’s (predominately white) audience’s complicity in the ‘true crime’ exploitation of the Osage Nation even as he, too late, centres the experience of Mollie Burkhart (Lily Gladstone) before passing the frame to the Osage as a final gesture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Hitchcock-inspired thriller complete with a Hitchcock Blonde named Rebecca. There’s an unusual tone but, like Anne Hathaway’s Rebecca, there’s a strange seductiveness to the whole thing even while you begin to wonder if the shoe is ever going to drop. It’s one of those films where there’s a very specific vibe and the success of the film depends on keying into that vibe. In that way, it reminded me of Paul Feig’s A SIMPLE FAVO(U)R and while that film leapt over the edge of sheer ridiculousness, EILEEN dances on the precipice but doesn’t quite fall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emerald Fennell follows up her debut with another black comedy dealing with a vector of privilege: this time, the British class system. However the satirising of the upper class never feels as precisely incisive as PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN’s examination of abusive men and “nice guys”. There’s a funny visual gag involving Harry Potter but the portrayal of the upper class family too often pivots into caricature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been to that carousel in Brooklyn: walked around the riverfront and had my photo taken in front of the Manhattan backdrop by the person I love. But PAST LIVES felt like a memory long before that scene. It’s so deeply and delicately enmeshed in a sense of time(s) and place(s) that it feels specific, it feels real, it feels like a memory in a way that &lt;a href=&#34;https://allunits.libsyn.com/calling-all-units-abuse-of-power-comes-as-no-surprise-tarantinocore-green-room&#34;&gt;tears a feeling open inside you&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the script’s jabs at the voyeuristic nature of cinema and Arthur’s (John Magaro) self-reflexive monologue about the clichéd story structure, PAST LIVES feels wholly original, wholly new, and wholly real.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A film with incredible depth of detail. On the big screen for the 30th anniversary, I caught so many small background details in almost every frame that catch the eye but aren’t visually overwhelming and make the world feel lived in. There are subtle character moments peppered throughout the screenplay that quietly expand the characters (despite abundant places for a helipad across the island, Hammond has deliberately placed it in a valley with wind shears so that it’s next to an amazing waterfall underscoring his prioritisation of spectacle over safety). Seeing it in the cinema, I was struck by the sound: the subtle ‘80s-style synth in the opening’s score and the incredible sound design of all the various dinosaurs’ different calls, especially the T. rex and velociraptors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the depth of his drunken despair, Tank (Julian Mayfield) stands in front of a carnival mirror and gives a funhouse description of the Black revolution to some credulous rich white people. It’s a great representation of Tank’s character: a successful union man who has unfortunately discovered he loved industry rather than the militancy required for revolution. UPTIGHT is deeply enmeshed in the radical politics of Black Power and the debate about the need for revolutionary violence but finds the personal amidst the political by centering the crisis of conscience of a man who would snitch on his brothers. Gorgeously lit and terrifically edited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing a series of &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/passages/&#34;&gt;films about deeply frustrating German men&lt;/a&gt;. Leon (Thomas Schubert) is always watching people from a distance and talking to them through windows accentuating the gulf he perceives between himself and other people. He’s one of life’s naysayers—saying no to others, to himself, to joy, to creative expression—and can be a real asshole but he’s relatable nonetheless. Christian Petzold directs with his characteristic light touch deftly commenting on narcissism, publishing, and climate crisis in ways that feel effortlessly natural. Even though the whole is a little uneven in tone, the film comes together beautifully and tragically in its final moments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If it’s possible for one scene to radically elevate an entire movie, it’s the scene where Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) gives his victory speech and the sound drops away apart from a solitary scream and the quiet aftermath of nuclear devastation. This scene sets off a quietly horrifying third act where it becomes clear how much Oppenheimer strives—and has been striving throughout the film—to never &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; what he’s done. The most gripping moments of the film are those few instants when this man who sees so much is brought close to actually seeing and understanding what he did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does an intelligent, socially conscious woman approach writing a Barbie movie in the year 2023? Greta Gerwig approaches it in a way not unlike Charlie Kaufman adapting Susan Orlean’s &lt;em&gt;The Orchid Thief&lt;/em&gt;: by deconstructing what it means to write a Barbie movie in our current sociopolitical moment and acknowledging the multivalent, complicated, and contradictory nature of Barbie’s image throughout the 20th Century and into the present. It’s a post-ironic, postmodern exploration of feminism and patriarchal capitalism wrapped in the pink and glitters of camp maximalist extravagance that, in a comparison I never expected, works like TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME in transforming a blonde white woman from an object to a subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ASTEROID CITY serves as something of an artistic statement for this period of Wes Anderson’s filmmaking, overtly discussing existential themes around meaning and, in particular, finding meaning through art that emphasise Anderson’s complicating of modernism and postmodernism. When Adrien Brody’s director character says that the meaning doesn’t matter, he’s talking through the fourth wall to viewers alienated by Anderson’s idiosyncratic aesthetics. ASTEROID CITY tells the viewer not only how to read it but how to read all of Anderson’s work by openly stating that how the viewer approaches his films is critical to how the works produce sincerity with and through their ironic postmodern conceits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quite apart from the blossoming of his distinctive aesthetic (developed in collaboration with his long-time cinematographer Robert Yeoman who rarely gets enough credit for it), RUSHMORE provides early insights into many of the deeper themes and preoccupations that would go on to define Wes Anderson’s work: a focus on class and social status particularly with regards to the hierarchy of positions within esoteric institutions; an eye for the outsider figure and the social outcast; a fascination with under the sea and the life aquatic. A story of a weird little guy told weirdly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cosmic mix of the dramas of the ‘10s combined with the exploitation films of the ‘70s. There is constant surprise in how layered and postmodern the film is willing to get but it always keeps a sense of playfulness and joy in its use of ‘70s exploitation tropes and metafictional devices right up until the end. Despite its postmodern flourishes, LEONOR WILL NEVER DIE remains grounded through the central focus on its characters and the wonderful sense of coming to know someone through their work and through their love of movies. Almost moves to the beat of jazz.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A competently-produced Catholic horror film drawing on THE OMEN, THE WICKER MAN, and THE SHINING. There’s a kernel of an interesting idea at the core of the narrative but the script needed at least one more draft and perhaps would have benefitted from leaning into schlocky rather than self-serious. There’s some stunning cinematography benefitting from the natural drama of Skye’s landscape and the use of Christian, specifically Catholic, imagery deepens the film with the weight of Christianity’s inherent horror but it doesn’t feel like it adds up to very much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The superhero movie that Marvel won’t provide: well-lit, practical effects, strongly defined character relationships and romantic entanglements. Seemingly a commentary on a film market saturated with superhero movies: it feels like Quentin Dupieux had to make a superhero movie because nothing else gets made these days and it was the only way he could tell his absurdist stories about fish concerned with water pollution, a helmet that traps you in your thoughts, and a liquified human’s remains in a bucket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I hear motorists and politicians complain about Extinction Rebellion or Just Stop Oil blocking roads, I think they ought to be thankful that the activists are engaging in such milquetoast actions. In a just world, their SUVs would be destroyed, fossil fuel extraction and refinement facilities would be expropriated and dismantled, and private planes would be permanently grounded. As Andreas Malm argues in the book that inspires this film, property destruction and sabotage are more than justified at this stage in the climate crisis. A few well-placed drone attacks on the private planes of the most obscenely wealthy and destructive could do wonders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Ordinaries (2022) - 120 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE ORDINARIES’ main character, Paula Feinmann (Fine Sendel), is a Supporting Character. Her father was a Main Character and she studies at the Main Character School to learn how to emote and how to draw the narrative’s attention to herself. It’s a meta conceit that pushes against the limits of cinematic structure in a way similar to Spike Jonze’s ADAPTATION or Charlie Kaufman’s SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK. Like Davey Wreden’s The Stanley Parable, the entire film is a metacommentary where the tension comes from the threat of the narrative collapsing under its own postmodern convolutions. THE ORDINARIES is successful inasmuch as it doesn’t collapse and says something about class and emotional expression even if the pacing falls off towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trapped in the intersection of mental health issues, trauma-induced anxiety, and contemporary Scottish racism, Grace (Déborah Lukumuena) seeks to insulate her and her daughter Ama (Le’Shantey Bonsu) against the world outside their high-rise flat. Ama seeks a world beyond her mother. A tough watch partly because Lukumuena’s striking performance was triggeringly accurate for me in her depiction of panic attacks. A beautiful film that shows an unbeautiful world: the lighting of Black skin was particularly impressive and effective in letting the actors express themselves through subtle gestures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year’s EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE: a joyous and hilarious blend of genres that uses irony and maximalist extravagance to speak sincerely about specific lived experience but in a universal way. POLITE SOCIETY is a modern Jane Austen story that combines wuxia films like CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON with comic-book style films like SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD all in service of a story that speaks to how modern British-Pakistani women approach practices like arranged marriage and how the generational trauma of second-generation immigrants continues to filter down to their children. Outstanding supporting turns from Ella Bruccoleri, Seraphina Beh, and Nimra Bucha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Women Talking (2022) - 104 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An adaptation less confident in its source material might have focused on what comes before and what happens after but WOMEN TALKING focuses in on the crux, the critical moments of decision that determine the fate of these women, their community, their families, and their religion. In so doing, the colony becomes a synecdoche for patriarchal society and their decision reflects the myriad of difficult decisions women need to make to survive and keep themselves safe. Excellent performances from Claire Foy and Jessie Buckley bring the film’s stagier aspects to life and an astonishing score by Hildur Guðnadóttir fills the silence between the talking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An exploration not just of the Sackler family and their role in the opioid crisis and the art world but of how alternative communities live, thrive, and survive. The film uses Nan Goldin’s work and her life as exemplars of alternative communities—queer communities, sex worker communities, activist communities—and shows the importance of friendship groups and artistic communities as alternatives to the suburban American family. Laura Poitras skilfully weaves together the threads of Goldin’s life, work, and activism towards a conclusion that just falls short of pointing at the nuclear family as a specific locus of structural oppression but very clearly gestures in that direction. Whether Sackler or Goldin, the family controls and suppresses ways of being and gets away with murder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A 1970s BBC British horror that has fallen through time to be released in 2023. The Volunteer (Mary Woodvine) undertakes the same ritual each and every day and it gradually becomes clear that she’s not a botanist but something deeper—something older—and that the flower she’s protecting is something more. ENYS MEN shows an England where nothing changes to such an extent that time starts flowing backwards and overlapping with itself. Memories, people, places, and objects all merge into one as the relentlessness of conservatism flattens everything into the same person, the same flower, the same menhir.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A post-apocalyptic period piece filmed in the context of the nuclear annihilation of two cities and 220,000 people, RASHOMON strips down humanity until it finds cynicism, deceit, selfishness, and despair. With no truth, there can be no agreement and no reconciliation or forgiveness even after the body’s death. It’s a bleak, empty, and egotistic world where everyone is out only for themselves. Until, that is, a baby cries and hope is found in the simple act of kindness to the generation who can rebuild this shattered world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
