      <title>Harvest (2024) - 133 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HARVEST is a period drama with the trappings of a folk horror and does not succeed as either. There’s no horror and the drama does not represent any particular period. It obliquely refers to the Highland Clearances without actually being embedded in the Scottish context of those events. HARVEST is an hour too long at the front and is poorly paced throughout, the characters are tediously obtuse, and the script loves to tell rather than show.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Luckiest Man in America (2024) - 90 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An entertainingly tense dramatisation of a small-scale situation on a 1980s US game show. THE LUCKIEST MAN IN AMERICA has some fun nostalgia aesthetics emulating the look of old VHS recordings (it specifically brought to mind Patrick Cotnoir’s visual work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0Bslw2hLzI&#34;&gt;this live reading of THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL&lt;/a&gt;). Paul Walter Hauser carries the film with a wonderfully ambiguous charm where you never quite know if he’s a charming happy-go-lucky guy or a snake oil salesman. Patti Harrison is sadly wasted but it’s always a joy to see her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Peacock (Pfau - Bin ich echt?) (2024) - 102 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s an interesting but undeveloped metaphor for neurodivergence in PEACOCK (PFAU - BIN ICH ECHT?), a film where Matthias (Albrecht Schuch) spends his entire life masking as part of his job playing various social roles for clients. He masks to such an extent that the person underneath begins to disappear, leading his girlfriend (Julia Franz Richter) to ask the titular question, “Are you real?” The film explores this alongside some other interesting questions around performance, honesty, and humanity but it all feels a little light by the end in a way that feels as if it hasn’t properly engaged with its weighty themes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An astonishing physical performance from Ben Foster drives this thriller where the villain is not a serial killer but road infrastructure and careless rural driving practices. Ben Foster is a charming, creepy, unreadable quiet little man whose obsession drives away his hot wife (played by Cobie Smulders who manages to do enough with the very little character that the screenplay gives). Foster’s secret seems to be bringing a little Tim Robinson energy to the role in a way that makes the script pop while also tapping into the deep pathos of the character and further establishes &lt;em&gt;I Think You Should Leave&lt;/em&gt; as the key text of our current sociocultural moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s something extra tense about a thriller that could be resolved instantly if the character just did something – anything – different: in this case if Nicolas Cage’s nameless protagonist just left the beach car park where he spends the entire film. Fortunately he doesn’t and director Lorcan Finnegan gives us a trippy take on the classic Cage performance, emphasising the deep psychological distress of this character and his one-man war of attrition against some mean Australians. A wildly entertaining film that portrays the stifling and oppressive atmosphere of a dry heat and the bizarre madness that it induces uncomfortably well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tornado (2025) - 100 mins</title>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/tornado/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The howling of the wind around walls and through trees dominates the soundscape of the film’s first half, subtly suggesting the Scottish landscape itself turning against Tornado (Kōki,). However the wind dies down in the second half as Tornado herself takes on the force of the wind and becomes the avenging samurai that the land needs. TORNADO has an incredible sense of place, embedded in the Scottish hills where the film was shot. The space is clearly articulated in the film such that we always have a sense of the geography of the lake around which the story takes place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The premise of becoming lost in an infinite hotel filled with eccentric inhabitants with clear inspiration from Kafka, BARTON FINK, &lt;em&gt;House of Leaves&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt; sounded like catnip to me. Disappointingly there’s not much more substance to MR. K beneath the web of allusions and references. There’s a terrifically blank performance from Crispin Glover playing the straight man and some terrific Jeunet and Andersson inspired production design and visual style but it doesn’t add up to much. A wonderfully strange and cosmic ending went some way to redeeming the whole however.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was extremely concerned that this documentary on the rise of American neo-fascism would sympathise with the three Proud Boys that it follows but was pleased to see that director Michael Premo’s detached style of documentary filmmaking simply observes the men exposing themselves as mendacious, stupid, incoherent, and selfish without particularly expecting the audience to care about their racist and bigoted concerns. These are men obsessed with their warped ideas of freedom and capitalism who like to indulge in the casual cruelty of threatening to crucify an “Antifa” protester or dumping gallons of paint on Black Lives Matter protesters. Living in 2025, it unfortunately feels like half a story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Stealing Pulp Fiction (2024) - 78 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That rarest of things for me: a legitimately funny comedy movie. There’s just the right balance of snappy dialogue, colourful characters, postmodern references, and absurdism. In expanding from his original short film, Danny Turkiewicz wisely recognises that this comedy doesn’t need the addition of big emotional arcs but just needs to be more. All you need to know is that it made me laugh after a busy day and one Jason Alexander bit about pickles had me crying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/hoard/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a film about hoarding and collecting excess, it’s almost appropriate how much cruft there is in HOARD that could have been edited out and pared down. This could have been a much tighter film about the looming spectre of family mental illness and how love and sexual awakening brings these chaotic demons to the surface. The central idea of the “catalogue of love” is heartbreaking in its tenderness and its grotesque implications and the film needed to be streamlined for that emotional throughline. Both Saura Lightfoot Leon and Lily-Beau Leach are terrific as Maria, bringing the strange poetry of her illness to life in a way that’s as beautiful as it is disturbing. HOARD just needed less of the excess around that central emotional structure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A pandemic sci-fi thriller that might be too much for those exhausted by the last few years but that offers an eerie atmosphere and some interesting twists and turns. Sometimes it’s hard to tell if I get frustrated by clumsy tropes because I’ve watched too many films or if it’s an unfortunate element of the script. Either way it’s a shame that this starts so promisingly and descends into a third act of genre tropes, most egregiously the computer that auto-plays the most narratively pertinent recordings when it turns on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>La chimera (2023) - 133 mins</title>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/la_chimera/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LA CHIMERA has an odd tempo, like a half-remembered story from long ago that becomes clearer when there’s a little rhyme to help you along. Arthur (Josh O’Connor) is a rogue archaeologist, robbing graves and raiding Etruscan tombs. His quasi-mystic gift for finding lost things through a weird dowsing ritual gives the film a mythic quality, rich with allegory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/sorcery/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SORCERY (BRUJERÍA) tells the fascinating story of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.4000/anthrovision.3946&#34;&gt;La Recta Provincia witch trial in 19th century Chile&lt;/a&gt; in a dull and dreary way. There’s resonant anti-colonial themes and an amazing performance from newcomer Valentina Véliz Caileo but the whole film around it feels so lifeless and flat, a slow burn that doesn’t lead to any explosion. SORCERY is interesting as an attempt to do what critics said &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/killers_of_the_flower_moon/&#34;&gt;KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON&lt;/a&gt; should do and show the murder of Indigenous people by white settlers from the perspective of the victims rather than the murderers but the overall result is disappointingly forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/lousy_carter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lousy Carter (David Krumholtz) is dying and Bob Byington’s film invites us to ask, who cares? On paper, he’s an unlikeable American literature professor, a narcissist with few friends who halfheartedly pursues a relationship with a student. But David Krumholtz brings him to life with a genuine humanism and dry charm. It’s a comedy that is wonderfully ambivalent about its own existence with the ultimate joke being that, despite openly hating itself, an audience can watch it and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/love_lies_bleeding/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last two seconds of SAINT MAUD prove Rose Glass is a visceral filmmaker and that’s on full aural and visual display in LOVE LIES BLEEDING: we hear the sounds of muscles stretching and throats constricting; we see jawbones breaking and blood spatter squelching. This visceral cinematic expression is in service of a modern-day THELMA AND LOUISE where queerness isn’t the backbone of the narrative but just one element of this love and revenge story. In different ways, Lou (Kristen Stewart) and Jackie (Katy O’Brian) both learn to embrace the metaphorical monsters that society has turned them into and use that self-knowledge for liberation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/the_creator/&#34;&gt;THE CREATOR&lt;/a&gt;, RESTORE POINT (BOD OBNOVY) showcases what CGI visual effects can be produced on a small budget in a way that puts much more expensive Hollywood blockbusters to shame. The BLADE RUNNER 2049-type skyline and the MINORITY REPORT slick technology all look great and fit into the world without obvious CGI aesthetics or horrendously offputting green-screen. Unfortunately the story also liberally borrows plot beats from other sci-fi films ultimately making the whole thing feel very familiar and very predictable. If you’ve seen I, ROBOT or Bodies, then you’ve seen this and it won’t surprise you to learn that the corporation behind the future technology might not be entirely trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Though a little off-putting, there’s something charming about the vourdalak puppet who looks something like a Jan Švankmajer creation crossed with one of Mike Mignola’s skeletons from &lt;em&gt;Hellboy in Hell&lt;/em&gt;. This strange puppet takes you out of the film but in a way that is at least interesting to look at and charmingly analogue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rub your tummy or I’ll think you’re an asshole. UNCUT GEMS in Glasgow: a tense, strange, and frequently hilarious psychological drama that gradually turns a ridiculous situation into the cosmic metaphysical horror of painful and anxious rebirth. Lorn Macdonald and Orlando Norman deliver terrific performances respectively as a hot mess of a tattoo artist and an anonymous popstar turned trickster god. It’s a wholly unexpected delight and a spectacularly confident debut feature from director Ciaran Lyons. Rub your tummy or I’ll think you’re an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A love story told backwards taking us from the devastating impact of a couple’s long-running emotional affair to the tragedy that cemented their lives together in the first place. THE BURNING SEASON joins a long lineage of media that &lt;a href=&#34;https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:56781&#34;&gt;I’ve discussed extensively elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; where trauma is represented through the depiction of non-linear time, through time warping around a traumatic event and pulling the characters back towards it like a black hole. A slight romantic drama made effective by some convincingly couple-y dialogue and performances that ground the central relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It may be strange to say at the end of &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/categories/bond/&#34;&gt;a series reviewing late-Bond through a political lens&lt;/a&gt; but NO TIME TO DIE works by focusing on the personal. Instead of the thin political themes of &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/quantum_of_solace/&#34;&gt;QUANTUM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/spectre/&#34;&gt;SPECTRE&lt;/a&gt;, we get a back-to-basics terrorist supervillain with an evil lair and zero motivation for his genocidal ambitions but also an actual narrative arc for James Bond and a script that gives Daniel Craig something to work with: the early scenes of Bond too broken by trauma to trust anyone are some of his best work in the role. There’s a smidge too many lines of dialogue that overexplain things to the audience but this is the first Bond script since &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/casino_royale/&#34;&gt;CASINO ROYALE&lt;/a&gt; that does more than shuttle us from set piece to set piece.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I always find myself using the word ‘deftly’ when reviewing &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/afire/&#34;&gt;Christian Petzold’s films&lt;/a&gt; but that’s because there’s an effortlessness to the filmmaking that feels so completely natural. In PHOENIX, Petzold deftly weaves threads of personal identity and political identity such that Nelly (Nina Hoss) rebuilding herself through the eyes of another after her unimaginable trauma is also the story of Germany reconstructing itself as a nation after the national shame of the Holocaust and Zionist Jews rebuilding themselves in Palestine as what Naomi Klein (2023) calls the “New Jew—that unbound alter ego of the pale, studious, melancholic Old Jew.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe the best way to explore the modern human condition is through black comedy. ROTTING IN THE SUN is an inventive and surprising satire on what it’s like to live now, in existences mediated by the internet. Apart from Vero (Catalina Saavedra), all the characters’ have their experience of the world mediated through their phones: from the opening shots of Sebastián (Sebastián Silva) googling how to commit suicide to the fatal moment of inattention while scrolling Instagram to the final scene of a manslaughter confession being garbled by a translation app. The depressed young creatives are in prisons of social media, of ego, and of the Instagram brands they’ve built around themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been here before,” starts Sam Smith’s theme for SPECTRE. And we have. SPECTRE recycles so many elements from previous Bonds in a rearrangement that is less than the sum of its parts: a seven-letter title and insight into Bond’s past like SKYFALL; a shadowy criminal organisation like QUANTUM; Bond and his love interest getting to know each other on a train like CASINO ROYALE; a high-speed boat chase down the Thames starting from the MI6 Building like WORLD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PAPRIKA has the visual and narrative inventiveness that fans of INCEPTION think it has. It’s a joyously confusing depiction of dreams and dreamscapes that I’ll need to watch a second time to properly take in. Kon Satoshi uses just enough analogy between dreams and both cinema and the internet to be intriguing but not to weigh the narrative down with allegory. The continual fat jokes raised an eyebrow but, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/tokyo_godfathers/&#34;&gt;TOKYO GODFATHERS&lt;/a&gt;’ queerness, it feels like they were in service of humanising a character who others might treat as ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to avoid reading this film through a class lens whereby Matthew Broderick’s character, Dr. Steve Finch, is positioned as the reasonable one in the central conflict entirely through his middle-class status rather than through any reasonable actions. His opulent suburban home and his status in a professional job establish him as the middle-class norm which is intruded upon by Buddy Hall (Danny DeVito), a debt-ridden working-class interloper whose Christmas decorations are offensive not because they disturb Steve per se but simply because they’re gauche compared to the Finch’s WASPy ‘traditional’ Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What stands out in David Lowery’s telling of &lt;em&gt;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&lt;/em&gt; is the film’s poetic depiction of a land perched between paganism and Christianity, in that boundary space between competing ways of life: a solstice of cultures, a time—like Christmas—when the barriers between worlds are made thin. The pagan forces of nature and the kingdoms of Christendom are at war throughout the film, fighting over a land that is already saturated with the red bloodshed of centuries. And what’s it all for? In the end, even as he dreams of running from his own mortality, Gawain (Dev Patel) discovers that he’s already rotting from the inside out. The green that The Lady (Alicia Vikander) tells us will take everything already took him and his kingdom long ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A victim of sloppy pre-production and the AMPTP’s failure to negotiate, QUANTUM OF SOLACE was clearly not ready to be made. Quite apart from the undercooked script, Eon Productions should have waited to settle with Kevin McClory’s estate so their shadowy criminal organisation could have been Spectre instead of the damp squib that is Quantum (though interesting in retrospect to use ‘Q’ as a symbol for their globalist conspiratorial organisation). The too-many action sequences are directed without a sense of spatial cohesion and the attempted themes around climate change, green(e)washing, and Western imperialist involvement in South American coups are too blunt to be incisive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every frame of this film is burned into my brain after watching it once every two years or so since I was old enough but it remains delightful every time, joyous every time, and I well up every time during the scene of the Christmas yet-to-come where Tiny Tim (Jerry Nelson) has died. It’s wild that this iteration of Kermit (Steve Whitmire), one not performed by Jim Henson, might be the most frequently-seen Kermit. Disney is leaving money on the table by not doing other literary adaptations with Muppets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Released at a time when the franchise had been overtaken in spectacle by Bourne and Mission: Impossible, Martin Campbell’s second slightly-harder Bond reboot wisely eschews a central action sequence in favour of an intimate and wonderfully tense extended poker game. It’s a brilliant sequence, all the more so for never wasting time spelling out the rules of Texas hold ‘em for the audience and trusting that, even if they don’t know a flush from a straight, the acting and direction will communicate the tension. The action sequences are good (especially free-running in Madagascar) but that central section makes the film.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A thoroughly charming found-family Christmas anime which mines comedy from some very tragic scenes and finds a delightful balance between those tragicomic elements. The film excels at weaving a twisting narrative but never feeling tangled. Some aspects of the portrayal of queerness through the character of Hana (Umegaki Yoshiaki) feel regressive in 2023 and through my particular cultural lens as a white Anglo critic but on the whole it feels like Kon Satoshi had his heart in the right place with it particularly as the characters deepen and reveal themselves throughout the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fassbinder introduces Petra von Kant (Margit Carstensen) in bed, stripped of her wigs and her extravagant clothes. He then painstakingly builds the character up in layers to show us exactly who this horrible woman is before just as painfully stripping away those layers as part of her emotional downfall. This film is a masterclass in shot composition and blocking, each shot as carefully composed as the image of &lt;em&gt;Midas and Bacchus&lt;/em&gt; in Petra’s bedroom and each revealing hidden emotional truths as Michael Ballhaus’s camera moves, focuses, and frames its subjects. The implication, told through small character beats and shot composition, that Marlene (Irm Hermann) was once the Petra to Petra’s Karin is quietly devastating: a vision of Petra’s future always present and always silent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s such a pleasure to see a big movie take its time building up its characters and its setting so that the eventual kaiju action has emotional and thematic resonance. We spend enough time with Kōichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki) and his family in post-war Tokyo that by the time Godzilla shows up in the city, we fully understand how he represents not only Kōichi’s PTSD and survivor’s guilt but the trauma of Japan writ large. The film even builds from there as a repudiation of how Japan conducted itself during the war and the state’s horrific disregard for its soldiers’ lives. One element of the ending is a smidge too far but the film had built up so much good will that I didn’t really mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A fairly languid biopic of Nora Barnacle (Susan Lynch) and her relationship with James Joyce (Ewan McGregor), a relationship that seemed as toxic as it was sexually charged. Lynch is pretty good as Nora, her hair growing ever larger and wilder the more neglected and abandoned she becomes. McGregor is never quite convincing as a tormented writer and his petty jealousies &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; petty rather than understandable which makes the central relationship feel weightless. &lt;a href=&#34;https://letterboxd.com/film/nora/&#34;&gt;Letterboxd&lt;/a&gt; draws its data from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/41165-nora&#34;&gt;TMDB API&lt;/a&gt; so we can blame them for Lynch getting second-billing behind a man in the cast credits on a movie where she plays the title character.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An origin story in the mould of JOKER in that the events of the narrative do not make the character into the character we see in other films. Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) starts the film as a chocolate-making eccentric and, sure, he acquires a chocolate factory by the end but that happens in thirty seconds after the film’s main narrative has been concluded. Chalamet is woefully miscast and this is most apparent whenever he attempts a line delivery like Gene Wilder. For a fun children’s film, a lot of scenes were horribly underlit (not helped by the digital projection at the multiplex where I saw it) which muted the colours. Go listen to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primus_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory_with_the_Fungi_Ensemble&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primus &amp;amp; the Chocolate Factory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Olivier Assayas’ CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA has an ineffable quality that makes it an artwork that is more than the sum of its parts. The themes around celebrity, artistic production, and the industry of cinema slowly open out into universal themes of ageing and confronting the person you once were as your youth fades. The central relationship between Maria (Juliette Binoche) and Val (Kristen Stewart) is beautifully observed and acted—prickly but intimate; tense but loving—and reminiscent of the mother-daughter relationship in Bergman’s AUTUMN SONATA. As the blending of fiction and reality muddle their emotions, the two women become intertwined before Val, the representation of the youth that Maria cannot come to terms with losing, the embodiment of her Sigrid, disappears like clouds drifting away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nobody is out here portraying the despair and loneliness of existing in capitalist spaces like Kaurismäki. We hear raucous laughter and joy through a door that Holappa (Jussi Vatanen) holds open but chooses not to go through. At this point in the film, he is too mired in the life-sapping energies of supermarkets, docks, and sad karaoke bars for that. Similarly Kaurismäki’s subversion of the romantic comedy gives his protagonists several opportunities to meet cutely and instead they deny themselves repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Bond film infused with the spirit of New Labour from the opening action scene focused on the triumphalist national symbolism of the Millennium Dome and the economic regeneration of the Isle of Dogs to the scenes where MI6 sets up temporary headquarters in Scotland acting as an allegory for devolution. Compare and contrast this film’s depiction of power moving from London to Scotland to the country’s appearance in 2012’s SKYFALL where it’s positioned as a dead and decaying ancestral home, an denuded place where no-one would ever look for Bond and M. Unfortunately, like New Labour, the film ultimately gets tied up in incoherent political and corporate plans involving oil and Russian oligarchs before getting bogged down by confused speeches and corny one-liners that simply aren’t meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple who communicate almost exclusively in bombshell decisions go away to Éire for Christmas and make decisions at each other. This bad Christmas movie gets points for actually being filmed in the Republic rather than a soundstage in Canada and for Justin Long who brings a measure of charm to a character who would be quite irritating on paper. I also enjoyed the young lad who gets self-help-pilled towards the end. Unfortunately one subplot hinges on a Christmas Eve Gaelic football match which goes on for like five to ten minutes onscreen and is very tedious to watch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The older women in this would have better chemistry as a lesbian couple than as sisters. I presumed the script had made them sisters so as not to alienate the conservative audience for this specific subgenre of bad Christmas romcoms. But then I thought, is that really the audience for these films? Has it not totally shifted to extremely online, irony-poisoned Letterboxd users like me who treat the whole month of December as a long MST3K episode? Are there still people watching this subgenre sincerely?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s something interesting about these Bond films from the End of History. Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) refers to Bond as a “decadent agent of a corrupt Western power” and it’s a joke but a joke that the film feels no need to seriously repudiate or counter. There’s no later scene where Wai Lin is shown the importance of the West or capitalist democracy: there’s just an ironic acceptance that this is how China perceives the UK. It expresses a sense of confidence and security in capitalist liberal democracy that simply doesn’t exist anymore. Similarly, it’s interesting that the villain is a recognisable capitalist entity—Rupert Murdoch’s press—rather than a vaguely ideologically-motivated terrorist or a disgruntled agent of a ‘rogue state’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The old is dying and the new cannot be born. Behind the onanistically triumphalist surface symbolism of this first post-Cold War Bond film with its literal graveyards of Soviet symbols and its rampages through freshly-capitalist Russia and communist Cuba, there is a hint of rot at the heart of both Bond and by extension England. Quite apart from the villain being a British double agent, Bond’s final act of killing for himself and not “for England” expresses the libertarian individualism that would eventually metastasize into Brexit. You get the sense from Martin Campbell’s first soft reboot of Bond that his direction was striving for more than could be allowed by the script’s caricatures—all the women and Bond himself come across as uncannily inhuman—and the ADRed quips clearly added in post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What better place for Poirot to comfortably retire in 1947 than Italy in the midst of its post-fascist reckoning and before the economic recovery brought about by the Marshall Plan? A HAUNTING IN VENICE showcases more technical competence than Branagh’s previous DEATH ON THE NILE (at least this one was filmed at least partly on location) but it’s similarly dramatically inert and sluggish without even the extravagant silliness that made NILE at least worth sitting through. As ever, Branagh prefers the vibe of Poirot to any actual rigour or method and so very little tangible evidence makes it through to the accusing parlour scene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But then! The second half injects genuine energy through Kristian Bruun’s (queer-coded?) villainous artisan baker and, most significantly, through Greg Lawson channelling Ricardo Montalbán at his most scenery-chewing in his role as Chef Paolo Joeljinjo, an enigmatic but strangely compelling judge of a local TV baking competition show. Lawson’s performance alone saves the film and honestly made me glad we didn’t turn the film off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most important shot in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is when Mikael (Daniel Craig) leans over Lisbeth (Rooney Mara) to find something on his computer and clumsily uses the trackpad to open the wrong applications mumbling to himself while struggling to find the right folder in macOS, all while Lisbeth watches him with a look of impatient contempt. Mikael is a skilled investigator but the core of the film is about Lisbeth and showing us what kind of mind is required to traverse the 21st Century information landscape of the internet, SQL databases, digital banking, and boxes of restricted physical archives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In one scene, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) and his yuppie colleagues briefly list all the progressive social issues that they’re aware of as ostensible members of society but clearly care about less than haircuts and business cards. It’s short but so incisively effective as a satire of capital’s liberalwashing tendencies that it’s a perfect synecdoche for the strength of Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner’s script: a script that is broad enough to be laugh out loud funny in its heightened ridiculousness yet precise enough to so devastatingly satirise a particular breed of Reaganite monster which has only grown in cultural prominence since.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you were to forensically analyse a single half-hour in the shared life of a couple, would it be possible to extrapolate out from that point to deduce the full shape of their life together? Could you chart their emotional topography from a single fight or a passive-aggressive gesture? As the film progresses, we see there’s no more emotional truth to this kind of analysis than there is in reading a novel as autobiography.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Kate’s (Kimberley Nixon) American mother is brought over to England from California at one day’s notice for the wedding of her ex-husband’s daughter and the mother is blankly accepting of this: she doesn’t even get a scene with her ex-husband to say ‘hello’ let alone acknowledge complex feelings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Janus Films’ restoration of INLAND EMPIRE’s original low-definition 480i29.97 digital video into UHD/4K 16x9 using Gigapixel AI machine-learning software introduces digital artifacts into many shots that give those shots the uncanny effect of images generated by text-to-image machine-learning programs like Midjourney or DALL-E. They are aesthetically unpleasant but in such a different way to the original’s low-definition digital graininess that the restoration almost seems to exist as an entirely different film in a different context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Surprisingly little of the film takes place in una città. Instead we alternate between scenes of women’s blouses being torn open and their breasts mutilated by zombie-vampires to scenes of characters wandering through fields or an abandoned theme park delivering the film’s tacked-on accelerationist message about the cyclical nature of civilisation and humanity bringing this on themselves with capitalist conveniences. Don’t climb a rollercoaster to escape from zombie-vampires.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As in M. R. James’ ghost stories, Joanna Hogg shows how memories gradually accrete in places—rooms, landscapes, countries—until those spaces buckle under the weight of meaning and become haunted by the past. When you return to these places, time slips out of joint and it’s not clear how many days or years pass in the same place or even when you are. You’re left haunted by the ghosts of feelings: an uncomfortable conversation, an awkward misunderstanding, a yearning to make another person happy in a way you never can, the slow-dripping sorrow of emotionally repressed Englishness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;David Fincher doing what he does best: exposing the facile hollowness and obsessive self-delusion of a particular kind of man. In this case, The Killer (Michael Fassbender) is the kind of 4chan-pilled Sigma who recites the 48 Laws of Power to himself, refers to other people as “normies” or NPCs, and relies on the silent labour and concealed structures of the gig economy to minimise his contact with other people. In his internal monologue, he’s a cool and efficient assassin with an unearned self-belief that is unshakeable no matter how many times he spectacularly fucks up or falls asleep on the job. Fincher hasn’t been as brutally ironic about a protagonist he clearly hates since THE SOCIAL NETWORK.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A British man saying the word ‘bullshite’ is a load-bearing element of the narrative in BEST SELLERS which is unfortunate since that’s not a word that any British person has ever said. Michael Caine presumably could have told the production team this if only he hadn’t obviously  looked at the script for the first time seconds before the camera started rolling. A dull and formulaic comedy-drama with limp performances (apart from an effervescent cameo from Cary Elwes) and no real understanding of how mainstream publishing works. The second-best book tour movie I’ve seen, far below THE END OF THE TOUR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It took me like five or ten minutes to dial into the tone of BOTTOMS because it’s a lot more heightened than I expected for a high-school comedy. But once I tapped into the specifically absurdist satirical tone, lying somewhere between MEAN GIRLS and THE NAKED GUN, I found one of the best comedies of the year. The story is a little formulaic but there’s more than enough wild subversion and basically every joke in the script (and improvised!) lands. Ayo Edebiri should be cast in everything (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cinemablend.com/superheroes/marvel-cinematic-universe/thunderbolts-ayo-edebiri-why-shes-excited-join-mcu&#34;&gt;apart from the MCU&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is as much about what is unspoken as KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON. Where KILLERS deals with an unspoken murderous racist conspiracy, INNOCENCE explores the unspoken labyrinth of social rules, mores, and traditions in which Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) eventually becomes trapped. Scorsese portrays a world in which every dinner table is a battleground and devastating social violence is enacted through declining an invitation. Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific as someone who deliberately eschews all the ritual and tradition but there’s a quiet power to Winona Ryder’s performance that only becomes apparent towards the end. Her blankness throughout is starkly brought into contrast in the scene where the power dynamics between May and Newland are flipped in an instant and the scene is wonderfully choreographed to assert her character’s dominance by having her kneel before Newland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The film adaptation of Carol Clover’s &lt;em&gt;Men, Women, and Chain Saws&lt;/em&gt;. Unsurprisingly this is much more subtle, clever, and effective than SCREAM (2022). SCREAM (1996) riffs on the ‘80s and ‘90s market saturation of horror films and slashers in particular in a way that feels authentic to the postmodernity of the ‘90s while also ensuring that the characters are well-drawn and have emotional cores. Wes Craven’s camera, especially in the opening scene, is far more interesting than in the requel with dynamic movements and subtle fisheye lenses. I was delighted to discover that characters opening doors while the music heightens and then there’s no killer behind the door is a franchise staple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Postmodernity and irony requires self-knowledge and it’s very easy for that sense of knowing to come off as smug. That’s the case when SCREAM ironically riffs on the idea of the legacy sequel, the requel, but does so without the core of sincerity that something like THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS or STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS has. The film is best when it’s good stabby fun and it’s not jamming in emotional crescendos for characters who have only just turned up. The scene of Wes (Dylan Minnette) opening multiple doors and the music heightening only for it to be a fake out every time could have gone on for hours and delighted me every time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Deserter in &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt; talks about “[t]he mask of humanity fall[ing] from capital. It has to take it off to kill everyone—everything you love; all the hope and tenderness in the world. It has to take it off, just for one second. To do the deed.” The horror in KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is how little the mask slips even as Osage people are murdered and brutalised. Black Wall Street and the KKK are backgrounded and instead the film is driven by the percussive bass beat of a more insidious form of racism: Hale (Robert De Niro) and Ernest (Leonardo DiCaprio) don’t hate the Osage—they learn their culture and their language—but they never view the Osage as people. Through their eyes, Osage are not capitalist subjects worthy of wealth but objects standing in the way of the money they view as their birthright as white men. Then in the film’s closing scenes, Scorsese turns the camera around to expose his own complicity and the film’s (predominately white) audience’s complicity in the ‘true crime’ exploitation of the Osage Nation even as he, too late, centres the experience of Mollie Burkhart (Lily Gladstone) before passing the frame to the Osage as a final gesture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A haunted house story with the vibe of creepypasta, specifically the Backrooms. This has a lot of the DNA of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-pj8OtyO2I&#34;&gt;THIS HOUSE HAS PEOPLE IN IT&lt;/a&gt;, SLEEP HAS HER HOUSE, and &lt;em&gt;House of Leaves&lt;/em&gt;. The constant low-angles and extreme close-ups of the digital cameras act like an eerie inversion of CCTV which leaves you tantalisingly unable to perceive the whole space. The quasi-experimental form messes with the pacing somewhat but it’s rare for me to find a horror film that genuinely scares me and there are slow pans in this that are more terrifying than any rapidly edited jump scares.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Martin Scorsese crafts a terrifically entertaining film that also manages to explore the intersection of identity and community in contemporary USA. From its opening moments, THE DEPARTED is focused on the interlocking (and overlapping) communities of American life—ethnic communities in Irish- and Italian-Americans; religious communities; professional communities in cops and criminals—and how the complexities of these communities both form and subsume individual identities like that of Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is desperate by the end of the film to rediscover who he actually is. It feels like the film owes a huge debt to The Wire in how it presents the interlocking of communities to form the tapestry of US American society. Most thrilling is how bold the filmmaking is: there’s barely a scene that goes by where Scorsese doesn’t make some minor but nonetheless exciting unconventional choice in cinematography, editing, music, or simply how his camera paints the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Martin Scorsese’s HUGO and Steven Spielberg’s THE FABELMANS would make a fascinating double-bil: one showing an artist in his late period exteriorising his love of cinema and the other interiorising it. Though THE FABELMANS starts a little saccharine for my tastes, the film matures along with Sammy Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle) and goes on the same psychological journey from the naïve depiction of film as a medium for discovery of truth in the world to exploring how a director shapes reality through documentary editing and makes an active choice as to how their film portrays people and the world. The most poignant moments are where Spielberg reaches through the screen to point out to us how the pursuit of art has mediated the experience of his life for good—the final camera tilt—and ill—Sammy seeing himself in the mirror filming his parents’ divorce. David Lynch playing the greatest living filmmaker is meta perfection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

FINAL DESTINATION 5 made me wonder about a hypothetical Final Destination that exploits the internal logic of strictly ordered deaths such that, as long as the person in front of you in the death queue is kept alive, you could do whatever kind of dangerous stuff you wanted. Combine this idea with SAW and you could put that person in a safe room or a medically-induced coma and could in that way become functionally immortal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite being a B-movie horror with a terrible script mostly set in a single back garden, I was struck by how much the whole film is elevated by having a well-trained canine actor playing Thor (Primo). In a cinema landscape filled with obviously-CGI animals like in the dreadful trailer for ARGYLLE, it’s notable how much emotional and narrative weight an animal actor can bring to a film. It makes even a werewolf flirting with his own sister seem more real.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The metaphorical linking of werewolves and menstruation seems so obvious and natural that it’s astonishing in retrospect that I’ve never seen it before, similar to the linking of vampirism and Catholicism in Mike Flanagan’s Midnight Mass. From a bumpy start that feels very ‘90s, GINGER SNAPS very effectively hides its low budget with some dynamic filmmaking, committed performances from Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins, and a great script with some deep thematic resonance around menstruation, womanhood, sisterhood, and the patriarchal social treatment of young women discovering their sexual hungers. The very smooth werewolf creature gave me the ick in a way that a traditionally hirsute werewolf never has.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) is a conflicted Wife Guy, frustrated by his realisation of his wife as a sexual being and simultaneously unable / unwilling to consummate his abstract sexual desire with any of the women (or men) who throw themselves at him as he descends into Dantean circles of dream. His libidinal fantasies—a beautiful and eager sex worker; a nymphet child—become completely unmoored from actual sexual desire at the dream’s deepest level with an orgy of anonymous vanilla sex free from blemishes, sweat, or any of the gritty humanness that actually makes sex exciting. His inability to consummate with anyone but his wife turns this into a nightmare as his mask literally falls away and the crowd threaten to strip him bare. Tom Cruise’s subsequent career has been a long affirmation of Kubrick’s casting as he has lost himself in dreams—cinema, endless blockbusters, a cult—while still retaining the tortured sense of inadequacy behind his eyes that we see here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steven Spielberg adopts the tropes and tone of John le Carré novels and Cold War thriller films and contorts them to fit a conflict with a wildly different power differential. As the film develops, the violence of the Israeli-sanctioned assassins expands in scope ultimately turning into a grotesque numbers game with Hans (Hanns Zischler) reeling off numbers of terrorist atrocities and deaths as if that can justify their state power’s campaign of ‘righteous’ revenge. The dialogue of violence becomes more and more one-sided and Spielberg doesn’t flinch from showing how broken, mad, and hollow that violence makes a person. The absence of Palestinian voices from the film is unfortunate but speaks to Spielberg’s understandable personal focus which is how Israel’s perpetual avenging violence drives a wedge between Jewish people and the nation they can no longer call ‘home’. The final shot of the World Trade Center dates the film as firmly early-’00s but emphasises the overall sense of despair at the prospect of peace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Hitchcock-inspired thriller complete with a Hitchcock Blonde named Rebecca. There’s an unusual tone but, like Anne Hathaway’s Rebecca, there’s a strange seductiveness to the whole thing even while you begin to wonder if the shoe is ever going to drop. It’s one of those films where there’s a very specific vibe and the success of the film depends on keying into that vibe. In that way, it reminded me of Paul Feig’s A SIMPLE FAVO(U)R and while that film leapt over the edge of sheer ridiculousness, EILEEN dances on the precipice but doesn’t quite fall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The titular ghoulies don’t do anything! Jonathan (Peter Liapis) summons the ghoulies to serve but all they do is hang out in the background chuckling menacingly. They’re so ineffective, he summons two actual servants later in the film. Even when it all kicks off, the ghoulies barely attack anyone or cause any mayhem. The untransformed mogwai in GREMLINS are more active and mischievous than the ghoulies are throughout the entire film. Stay to the end for Jack Nance the secret warlock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s such a shame that THE CREATOR’s script isn’t strong enough to support its weighty themes because it’d be great to see a good high-concept sci-fi blockbuster that is as resolutely anti-American as this. As it is, the film’s themes around US imperialism and Western xenophobia get lost in weak narrative convolutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The insensitively-titled WHITE SETTLERS is a low-budget representation of how culturally afraid the English are of the Scottish. Released during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/08/scottish-referendum-horror-movie-white-settlers&#34;&gt;director Simeon Halligan spoke in an interview&lt;/a&gt; about &amp;ldquo;a sense that there is an intolerance or a lack of understanding from both sides&amp;rdquo; and that bland centrism comes across in the film’s confusion about what point it wants to make, if any, about Anglo-Scottish relations. The Scots are depicted as barbaric pig-men, the English as pretentious cowardly dullards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emerald Fennell follows up her debut with another black comedy dealing with a vector of privilege: this time, the British class system. However the satirising of the upper class never feels as precisely incisive as PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN’s examination of abusive men and “nice guys”. There’s a funny visual gag involving Harry Potter but the portrayal of the upper class family too often pivots into caricature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of flashbacks, early-’00s montages, and repetition to hide the fact that there’s really not much to this movie. It’s desperately aspiring to be SEVEN but lacking the care and attention to character that Fincher brings to that film. Instead it focuses on SEVEN’s final scene attempting to craft enough twists, inversions, and narrative convolutions to evoke the idea of a satisfying narrative twist. Cary Elwes is a good actor and so it’s a little strange how poor he is in this especially in the third act. Is the involvement of the puppet explained in a subsequent one of these or no?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a phenomenal move to &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; the film with Mark (Sam Neill) already driven mad by the claustrophobic suspicion of the Cold War and his role as a functionary of repressive state apparatus. Żuławski only pushes the character further from there, driving Mark deeper and deeper into the psychosis of his toxic masculinity, his reliance on failing heteropatriarchal norms, and his inability to comprehend the sheer force of his wife’s desire. It takes the film to a fever pitch of intensity that very few films are able to match. Isabelle Adjani brings a terrifying intensity to her role and is both wildly unsettling and more attractive than anyone else has ever looked on screen. Disjointed and unnerving and all the more brilliant for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A best-of of the Alien franchise that brings together the best elements of the series but never manages to resolve the franchise’s long-running identity crisis. Though &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@SimonXIX/alien-covenant-removing-the-alien-from-alien-a02b32ee6911&#34;&gt;I hated this when it came out&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve softened on it a lot and think it works well at building slow-burn tension, developing interesting characters, and pursuing some resonant themes around colonialism, imperialism, and genocide, creation and destruction, and fascism’s pursuit of imagined purity. However it falls down in its attempts to link to the other films in the franchise particularly &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/prometheus/&#34;&gt;PROMETHEUS&lt;/a&gt; and ALIEN and its position in the franchise canon as an explanation of the Xenomorphs’ origins is a fundamentally misguided and self-defeating endeavour. Better than I remembered but a film that should not exist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A grand, sweeping science-fiction spectacle that is utterly hampered by the script’s atrocious dialogue, clunky exposition, weird pacing, and scientist characters that never act like scientists. It’s as if Jon Spaihts’ original script for Alien: Engineers were run through a machine-learning tool which inserted as many of Damon Lindelof’s late-’00s to early-’10s writing quirks and thematic obsessions as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An undeniably bourgeois but sensitive drama about the dull yet emotionally fraught admin and logistics of the end of a life. Assayas portrays the deep melancholy of dividing up the residue left in the shape of a person after they’re gone and the sadness of seeing an object that has been used, cherished, and loved being turned into a museum piece for people to walk past. It’s a generous, wistful film with just enough of a hint of sharp social criticism underneath: both of the mercenary way the house’s objects are seized upon and the implied incestuous proclivities of the bourgeois artistic set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EL CONDE’s opening narration carries the underlying implication that the major figures of late 20th Century neoliberalism were literal vampires. By the end, any subtlety to this satire is gone and the heavy-handedness of the allegory becomes rather draining. The film’s interesting if unsubtle allegory positioning neoliberal politicians influenced by the Chicago Boys as bloodsucking vampires is undermined by the third act’s frankly silly revelations. There are some undeniably beautiful images—a young Pinoche (Clemente Rodríguez) licking blood off a guillotine’s blade in Revolutionary France; the older Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) gliding above the streets of Santiago, cape flapping in the breeze—but they’re in service of a film that never really comes together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been to that carousel in Brooklyn: walked around the riverfront and had my photo taken in front of the Manhattan backdrop by the person I love. But PAST LIVES felt like a memory long before that scene. It’s so deeply and delicately enmeshed in a sense of time(s) and place(s) that it feels specific, it feels real, it feels like a memory in a way that &lt;a href=&#34;https://allunits.libsyn.com/calling-all-units-abuse-of-power-comes-as-no-surprise-tarantinocore-green-room&#34;&gt;tears a feeling open inside you&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the script’s jabs at the voyeuristic nature of cinema and Arthur’s (John Magaro) self-reflexive monologue about the clichéd story structure, PAST LIVES feels wholly original, wholly new, and wholly real.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A very charming little film about loneliness, ennui, and displacement. The film is driven by Anaita Wali Zada’s subtly expressive central performance but there’s something to love in both of the other two central players, Gregg Turkington and Jeremy Allen White, each expressing a different facet of American loneliness. There’s more than a little bit of Ben Sharrock’s LIMBO in how the film is shot and how the camera’s rigidity, its fixedness, and the boxy, claustrophobic frame speaks to the film’s themes. A quietly devastating critique of America’s imperialism and platitudinous culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The faces of white people are always obscured in BROTHER, either positioned just out of frame or out of focus in the background of a shot. The film tells us that we don’t need to see the face of the oppressor: they are faceless, formless. Instead we see the effects of Black trauma reverberating through non-linear time, ripples spreading backwards and forwards through the timeline of a life from one devastating moment. Aaron Pierre is an incredible on-screen presence as Francis, the one person in Michael’s (Lamar Johnson) life that makes him feel safe and the entire film is structured around that relationship and that sense of safety. How do you continue when that safety is suddenly taken away?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like BARBARIAN, it’s disappointing how X uses elderly women’s bodies as a locus of horror especially when Natalie Erika James’ &lt;a href=&#34;https://takeonecinema.net/2020/relic/&#34;&gt;RELIC&lt;/a&gt; so effectively subverted this trope to much less popular acclaim. To its credit, X does complicate its depiction of elderly sexuality with some degree of sympathy for its antagonists and its depiction of sexuality as fundamentally human. It builds tension effectively enough and its self-awareness is somewhat fun but the film is ultimately too in thrall to its 1970s slasher references especially THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and simply isn’t enough of a subversion of the rural horror subgenre to be any more than a retread.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There simply aren’t enough choices: why does Cami (Laura Marano) have to end up with any of these irritatingly bland men; why can’t she end up with all of them; why couldn’t she make some friends who aren’t her sister; why couldn’t she have beaten up the kid who picked on her niece? Bizarrely structured, cheap looking, and less fun than a standard Hallmark.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A film with incredible depth of detail. On the big screen for the 30th anniversary, I caught so many small background details in almost every frame that catch the eye but aren’t visually overwhelming and make the world feel lived in. There are subtle character moments peppered throughout the screenplay that quietly expand the characters (despite abundant places for a helipad across the island, Hammond has deliberately placed it in a valley with wind shears so that it’s next to an amazing waterfall underscoring his prioritisation of spectacle over safety). Seeing it in the cinema, I was struck by the sound: the subtle ‘80s-style synth in the opening’s score and the incredible sound design of all the various dinosaurs’ different calls, especially the T. rex and velociraptors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Despite the grander scale (mostly conveyed by the physics-defyingly huge alien ship of this film), there are several elements that come together to make everything feel much smaller than the original film. The green screen soundscape visuals and CGI effects look worse and feel smaller than the original’s exterior shooting and impressive miniatures. Rather than a rag-tag cast of characters who come together in the end to triumph as one, all the characters start the film already connected and never actually need help from any other nation on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the depth of his drunken despair, Tank (Julian Mayfield) stands in front of a carnival mirror and gives a funhouse description of the Black revolution to some credulous rich white people. It’s a great representation of Tank’s character: a successful union man who has unfortunately discovered he loved industry rather than the militancy required for revolution. UPTIGHT is deeply enmeshed in the radical politics of Black Power and the debate about the need for revolutionary violence but finds the personal amidst the political by centering the crisis of conscience of a man who would snitch on his brothers. Gorgeously lit and terrifically edited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PHANTASM resonates with a specific Lynchian frequency while also operating with a Buñuelian sense of dream (nightmare) logic. It almost seems to anticipate elements of Lynch’s DUNE, BLUE VELVET, and Twin Peaks and shares Lynch’s preoccupation with the weirdness of the American suburbs. Specifically PHANTASM explores the uncanniness of suburban funeral parlours and cemeteries: monumental edifices built for mourning and death that take up prominent space in our towns but which by unspoken understanding we as a society have all agreed to turn away from as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Look, I’m not a stickler about spoilers and often think hysteria about spoilers is ridiculous but I feel I would have gotten more out of this if Amazon Prime Video’s description wasn’t a concise summary of the last five minutes of the film. Cronenberg is at the cusp of something with this film: a move from more straightforward filmmaking towards something more abstract yet somehow more visceral, more psychological, more—what will eventually be known as—Cronenbergian. THE BROOD’s mix of these elements isn’t quite right yet and doesn’t quite cohere. Uneven but entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Leon (Thomas Schubert) is always watching people from a distance and talking to them through windows accentuating the gulf he perceives between himself and other people. He’s one of life’s naysayers—saying no to others, to himself, to joy, to creative expression—and can be a real asshole but he’s relatable nonetheless. Christian Petzold directs with his characteristic light touch deftly commenting on narcissism, publishing, and climate crisis in ways that feel effortlessly natural. Even though the whole is a little uneven in tone, the film comes together beautifully and tragically in its final moments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A relatively grounded—for Quentin Dupieux—meditation on ageing and rejuvenation via two interconnected stories. ‘Grounded’ here involves a time-defying tunnel in a basement and an electronic iPenis but still more verité than Dupieux’s RUBBER or DEERSKIN. This isn’t nearly as effective as his more Surrealist work and could have worked better as a short film: as it starts to outstay its welcome, it wisely descends into montage as events spiral to their all-too inevitable conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tomas (Franz Rogowski) is an intense and chaotic star, pulling people into his orbit and taking position at the centre of their lives. This is most clear in the shots where his body literally eclipses one of his romantic partners in the frame (apart from one significant sex scene). He’s a deeply frustrating and overwhelmingly narcissistic man and it’s testament to Rogowski’s charm that it takes so long for this to become apparent and that, even when it does, Tomas remains human to the audience: contradictory, both fluid and rigid at once.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every musical cue from this is burned into my brain from dozens of VHS viewings as a kid. It’s an essential part of the canon of ‘70s–’80s children’s fantasy films that hid traumatisingly terrifying or unsettling scenes along with RETURN TO OZ and WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. This era of production design—matte painting backgrounds, practical puppet effects—was key to my sense of how fantasy cinema should look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steven Beard (Eli Gabay) is the exemplar American man: extraordinarily wealthy despite having no apparent job and consisting on a diet exclusively of beef. His new wife, Celeste (Julie Benz) plots to have him injured just enough so that he has time to change his will before dying. Despite Celeste’s plot to seduce a rich man and have her lesbian lover shoot him, the film is oddly sexless and a last-minute evocation of the Bible leaves the viewer wondering if this was a Christian movie all along.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CORNER OFFICE taps into a specific niche of absurdism directed at the banalities of everyday existence that I associate with Scandinavian directors like Roy Andersson and Thomas Vinterberg. Beneath the film’s chilly Brutalist surface, there’s a Kafkaesque examination of the anomie and mental compartmentalisation required by the 21st Century corporate workplace that really clicked for me. Jon Hamm excels himself with a performance that taps into the sheer unpleasantness demanded of a good corporate worker and carries the film along with a dour, monotonous, and fascinatingly grotesque narration. Reminded me of Richard Ayoade’s THE DOUBLE by way of The Stanley Parable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s astonishing to me that this never looks nearly as good as Peter Jackson’s THE LORD OF THE RINGS films which were made over twenty years ago and, adjusted for inflation, with each film costing roughly the same as this. The scene with Bradley Cooper’s halfling uses such obvious green screen compositing and digital backgrounds that it looks terrible compared to the physical forced perspective used in the Bag End scenes between Bilbo and Gandalf at the very start of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amy Jump and Ben Wheatley pull out a three minute shootout scene from a standard action film and expand it to a full ninety minutes making every bullet impact important, every injury significant, and every movement a struggle. This expansion stretches the characters fairly thin but strong performances especially from Cillian Murphy, Michael Smiley, and Sharlto Copley buoy them up. Not nearly as stylish and Tarantino-esque as it thinks it is but it makes up for that by embodying precisely what Tarantino doesn’t: stripped-down and economic filmmaking. Up the ‘RA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a sense of horror in the description of the ‘college campus’ atmosphere that these intelligent, liberal young scientists brought to the top secret military base where they were constructing weapons of mass destruction. Jon Else is unequivocal in his condemnation of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and very squarely blames inertia for the bombing: that not one of the ‘great men’ involved—Oppenheimer, Truman, Groves—had the courage to stand in front of the political machinery of military, industry, and capital that had already been set in motion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christopher McQuarrie is a better Mission: Impossible director than screenwriter. Aside from this script’s unclear motivation for the antagonists and overreliance on rubber mask twists, McQuarrie’s bad habits emerge throughout &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/mission_impossible_rogue_nation/&#34;&gt;ROGUE NATION&lt;/a&gt; and FALLOUT and come to full fruition in &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/mission_impossible_dead_reckoning/&#34;&gt;DEAD RECKONING PART ONE&lt;/a&gt;: the mythologisation of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) as global saviour figure; the self-sacrificing and vaguely cult-like nature of the IMF; the emphasis on ‘friendship’ as an emotional locus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Within a three-month period in 1995, THE NET and then HACKERS came out: the Barbenheimer of 1990s computer-themed thrillers. THE NET has none of the joie de vivre of HACKERS and no amount of extreme close-ups on character’s mouths or computer GUIs can save it. Multiple characters in this film order a Gibson, a gin martini with a pickled onion instead of an olive, and yet their shared love for this unusual cocktail is not a plot point, presumably it’s just a cocktail that the screenwriters like. The best bit was when Senator Martin (Diane Baker) from THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS showed up and I could do Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill impressions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If it’s possible for one scene to radically elevate an entire movie, it’s the scene where Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) gives his victory speech and the sound drops away apart from a solitary scream and the quiet aftermath of nuclear devastation. This scene sets off a quietly horrifying third act where it becomes clear how much Oppenheimer strives—and has been striving throughout the film—to never &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; what he’s done. The most gripping moments of the film are those few instants when this man who sees so much is brought close to actually seeing and understanding what he did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some great set pieces especially the underwater heist and the opera scene but overall a step backwards in terms of direction, script, and cinematography. Sean Harris and his weak chin make for a good villain and the ‘anti-IMF’ concept is strong: this should have been the foundation for a two-parter not &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/mission_impossible_dead_reckoning/&#34;&gt;DEAD RECKONING’s&lt;/a&gt; nebulous rogue AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A film about discovering Scotland’s power to slow you down and let you see the world around you. It feels strange to use the word ‘efficient’ to describe the greatest movie ever made on the multivalent concept of ‘value’ but it’s striking how efficient Bill Forsyth’s scripting and staging are. There’s not a wasted scene or shot in the whole movie: each one contributes a character beat, a plot point, or a thematic development. LOCAL HERO does a wonderful job of making the community of Ferness into a collective character à la the islanders in WHISKY GALORE! while also ensuring that they’re all clearly defined individual characters in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does an intelligent, socially conscious woman approach writing a Barbie movie in the year 2023? Greta Gerwig approaches it in a way not unlike Charlie Kaufman adapting Susan Orlean’s &lt;em&gt;The Orchid Thief&lt;/em&gt;: by deconstructing what it means to write a Barbie movie in our current sociopolitical moment and acknowledging the multivalent, complicated, and contradictory nature of Barbie’s image throughout the 20th Century and into the present. It’s a post-ironic, postmodern exploration of feminism and patriarchal capitalism wrapped in the pink and glitters of camp maximalist extravagance that, in a comparison I never expected, works like TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME in transforming a blonde white woman from an object to a subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The action scenes are coherent in space and time, look great, and actually build a sense of tension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mission: Impossible is proving to be a great franchise for charting trends of Hollywood filmmaking over the last 30 years. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 is a perfectly preserved relic of high-octane early-2000s excess replete with nu metal, John Woo’s distracting slow-mo action scene cinematography, a particular brand of ‘edgy’ (but not yet ironised) casual misogyny, and a sense of pre-9/11 American triumphalism that is unafraid to imply that the USA has a horrifyingly comprehensive global surveillance program. There’s also a charged sense of (heteronormative) sexuality (partly expressed through an ill-fated attempt at a ‘sexy’ Tom Cruise) that, while not altogether successful in this film, is notable as basically absent from today’s blockbusters. Fans of heavy-handed symbolism should look out for the many doves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A fascinating time capsule of a movie that, viewed alongside the latest film in the series, speaks volumes about how this franchise has adapted to filmmaking trends over almost 30 years. Jon Voight’s character lights up a cigarette on a plane; Usenet groups are a key plot point; everything about Danny Elfman’s score: all incredibly and indelibly ‘90s. Brian De Palma crafts a much more interesting film than &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/mission_impossible_dead_reckoning/&#34;&gt;DEAD RECKONING PART ONE&lt;/a&gt; and Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt way more interestingly, really tapping into a trickster quality of the character in a way that has been reduced in his most recent po-faced portrayal of the same character thirty years later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Venice is a ghost town in this movie. Presumably due to Covid restrictions during filming, the city is heartbreakingly empty. Piazza San Marco and Campo della Salute bustle with tourists, even at night, and yet here they have only one or two people milling about as a backdrop for the main characters. It’s emblematic of the film which sees a dozen beautiful people fight amongst themselves in beautiful locations that feel devoid of civilians or actual threat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A prurient and nasty film with deeply conservative undercurrents. REQUIEM not only cannot comprehend the anti-capitalist message of the original ALIEN but transforms the (sub-)franchise into something horribly regressive in service of cutting the Xenomorph down into a monster from a generic slasher movie and symbolically punishing the people on the lowest rungs of neoliberal society. Though the film is often too dark to see the actual scenes, what we can see in this film are embryonic traces of the franchise blockbuster model which will soon come to dominate 21st Century Hollywood filmmaking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nakedly militaristic propaganda made by a military-entertainment complex secure in its sense of victory in the interregnum between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the USSR. But terrifically well-made nakedly militaristic propaganda. John McTiernan provides a masterclass in creating tension out of confined locations especially the submarine sets (built on hydraulic gimbals to simulate the sub tilting!). But even the non-submarine scenes have a cramped look as if the rooms themselves are closing in on the protagonists. A collection of incredible actors at the top of their game with Scott Glenn and Sam Neill both doing amazing work. Zooming in on Political Officer Putin’s mouth as a way to signify transition from spoken Russian to spoken English in the &lt;em&gt;Red October&lt;/em&gt; scenes is such a fun device for a practical purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to read THE DARJEELING LIMITED as self-indulgent: three wealthy white American men searching for a spiritual experience in a culture with which they make no effort to engage. But I think that self-indulgence is both personal and self-reflective for the three white men who wrote it. The film is self-aware enough to laugh at its protagonists while remaining grounded in their humanity and the humanity of those around them. In that way, it’s a very generous film about trauma, familial hurt, and emotional repression, lesser than &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/the_royal_tenenbaums/&#34;&gt;TENENBAUMS&lt;/a&gt; but meaningful nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this final Robinson film, Patrick Keiller examines capitalism as a lichen that has spread out from its origins in England outward to infect the entire world. Unfortunately its focus is so thoroughly on economics and in particular the macroeconomics of 2008 that it loses the cultural and political commentary that made the first two films work. The absence of Paul Scofield’s familiar narration distances the narrative from Robinson and the character’s somewhat grounding and humanising influence. RUINS also has a far more languid pace, proceeding glacially compared to the more dynamic &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/london/&#34;&gt;LONDON&lt;/a&gt; which remains the strongest of the three films.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for &lt;a href=&#34;https://takeonecinema.net/thexenopod/&#34;&gt;our podcast&lt;/a&gt;, it’s more interesting to discuss this film than it is to watch it. The film itself is bland and generic with paper-thin characters, a frankly unappealing visual aesthetic, and dialogue that could have been spat out by a machine-learning model. But it represents a fascinating point for the Alien franchise’s turn from a multimedia to a transmedia franchise and occupies a contested position as both mothership text and paratext. There’s also an intriguing path not taken with the Black female main character and the shooting script’s promise that she will return in the unmade Alien/Predator: Annihilation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An intelligent thriller that trusts its audience to understand that every character both believes they are doing the right thing and are also continually questioning that belief. There are no comic book villains, only a web of different and conflicting motivations that Philip Seymour Hoffman’s Günther uses to slowly but surely tighten the net around his targets. Even through a questionable German accent, Hoffman gives a quietly gripping performance as a greasier version of George Smiley, a man who is very easy to ignore even as he pulls others into orbit around him. Ultimately we’re left to question how it even makes sense to condemn someone when everyone around them is pushing them through a funnel with only one possible exit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went into this rewatch thinking that this might drop in &lt;a href=&#34;https://letterboxd.com/simonxix/list/wes-anderson-ranking/&#34;&gt;my Wes Anderson ranking&lt;/a&gt;. If anything, I’m considering moving it higher. Multiple scenes in TENENBAUMS are among the most transcendently beautiful filmmaking of Anderson’s entire career: notably young Richie Tenenbaum (Arianna Turturro) releasing Mordecai; the ‘These Days’ shot; Chas (Ben Stiller) releasing his pain to his father. TENENBAUMS is a profoundly moving depiction of emotional repression and stunted family dynamics that doesn’t hold your hand in explaining the emotional complexities of its characters’ inner lives. It’s also the best cinematic adaptation of David Foster Wallace’s &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt; that could ever exist (more so for only ever being coincidentally(?) similar).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A considered depiction of a home that has become a prison—with many other prisons inside it. Nested like Russian dolls inside the prison of the couple’s modernist James Melvin house are the prison of their marriage, the prison of the family they never had, the prison of their artistic careers, and, most significantly, the prison they’ve built between them of how they interact with one another, as if their marriage were an artistic project rather than an emotional engagement. Not as devastating as Joanna Hogg’s other films and altogether quieter but an interesting chapter in her ongoing cinematic dissection of the English middle class.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until the film’s final scene, I would have said that this is, surprisingly, Wes Anderson’s most anti-capitalist film: the contrast between the coldly metallic heavy industrialisation of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean’s farms and the warm autumnal palette of the animals’ home; Mr. Fox’s (George Clooney) embrace of his wild animal nature. The last shot, a long shot of a huge big-box supermarket, complicates this reading. Has Mr. Fox in some sense been domesticated by neoliberal convenience? Is capitalist normativity just a different kind of fox-trap for him?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remembered this as the slightest of Wes Anderson’s live-action scripts with Roman Coppola, most notable for the extreme precision of the film’s Andersonian clockwork diorama world and evocativeness of music and visuals. Yet I was moved to tears by the scene between Roebuck Wright (Jeffrey Wright) and Lt. Nescaffier (Stephen Park) which exemplifies all the film’s themes—which I’d either forgotten or missed the first time—around loneliness and yearning for human connection. That brief moment of connection between a foreign immigrant and an expatriate homosexual both “[s]eeking something missing, missing something left behind” and hoping to “find what eluded us in the places we once called home”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like the main characters, this film has a charm and a sincerity that are both beguiling even while it settles into a diffuseness that feels a little frustrating. There’s a good mix of Coen Brothers’ postmodern sensibility with Godard’s rebellious young man archetype but this also takes on some of the worst qualities of both in its sense of youthful aimlessness. It didn’t really work for me but it’s interesting to see the embryonic elements of Wes Anderson’s aesthetic steadily emerge particularly in the sequences reshot from the short film version.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an essay for the Criterion Collection Blu-ray, Isabel Folger writes that “Moonrise Kingdom shows that with the right people in your life, you won’t feel misunderstood.” There are some emotional moments that are so powerful that they justify entire films about them. MOONRISE KINGDOM is about that moment that you are seen—truly seen—for the first time. When Sam (Jared Gilman) sees Suzy (Kara Hayward), it doesn’t matter that they’ve never fit in before, that they’ve been labelled “emotionally disturbed” or “very troubled”. They find that one other person and suddenly fit just right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Titan_submersible_incident&#34;&gt;The Titan submersible incident&lt;/a&gt; prompted a response by James Cameron highlighting his approach to underwater exploration. I’m struck by the contrast between Wes Anderson’s almost childlike reverence for undersea explorers in the outdated model of Jacques Costeau, expressed in THE LIFE AQUATIC and &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/rushmore/&#34;&gt;RUSHMORE&lt;/a&gt;, and Cameron’s much more masculine-coded urge to conquer the depths harnessing advanced technology for his pursuit. Anderson’s view of someone who would explore the ocean is far more melancholic with Zissou cast as a tragic figure: not a hero, but someone ineluctably human and flawed, deeply so. Ultimately both Zissou and Cameron must face the same question when confronted with the immense indifference of the oceanic world beyond them, “I wonder if it remembers me?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of the film, the Newborn is violently sucked through a tiny hole into Earth’s upper atmosphere. This film feels like trying to suck the Alien franchise through a much-diminished perspective to become a generic and misogynistic blockbuster. Most of the blame must lie with Whedon’s script which firmly shifts the sexual locus of the franchise from ALIEN’s ‘monstrous feminine’ to the most mundane implementation of male gaze from the perspective of a teenage boy. Ripley’s new ‘sexy but threatening’ persona completely disregards what worked about the character in the previous films. A script that doesn’t work with a director who does not fit the Alien franchise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SLIVER wants to be about voyeurism, surveillance, and power. But gesturing towards themes while not saying anything substantive about them is not enough for thematic resonance. There’s a kernel of an idea in the sequence where Carly (Sharon Stone) watches from the surveillance room as a teenager reveals her father’s abuse of her and then Carly sees the two in the elevator. Knowing the secrets of your neighbours but being unable to take action because of how you know about them is interesting. But the film isn’t interested in that and gets tangled in narrative convolutions while being about as deep as THE DARK KNIGHT on actual surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ASTEROID CITY serves as something of an artistic statement for this period of Wes Anderson’s filmmaking, overtly discussing existential themes around meaning and, in particular, finding meaning through art that emphasise Anderson’s complicating of modernism and postmodernism. When Adrien Brody’s director character says that the meaning doesn’t matter, he’s talking through the fourth wall to viewers alienated by Anderson’s idiosyncratic aesthetics. ASTEROID CITY tells the viewer not only how to read it but how to read all of Anderson’s work by openly stating that how the viewer approaches his films is critical to how the works produce sincerity with and through their ironic postmodern conceits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In terms of melancholy, this skews more towards A BUNCH OF AMATEURS as the documentary reveals the petty dramas of the filmmakers’ childhood that pushed them apart and the quasi-dangerous obsession that completing their film has become. There’s an ‘80s Stephen Kingish poignancy throughout in the implication that their lives’ biggest achievement is something they did as kids.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“It’s always difficult coming back to England[&amp;hellip;]”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Keiller’s peripatetic essay films remind me of the best of David Foster Wallace’s creative non-fiction (his visits to the State Fair, the pornography convention, and the cruise) in their style and digressive nature. They both share a sense of minutely detailed reportage gradually accreting into unerringly precise interpretative analysis. This one is a little more diffuse in focus than &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/london/&#34;&gt;LONDON&lt;/a&gt;, psychocartographically charting England’s post-modern decline through the prism of industrialisation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A sensitive and joyously optimistic documentary about living with a condition in an industry that punishes things it sees as disabilities. Michael J. Fox comes across as charming, witty, and self-reflective in a way rarely seen in Hollywood actors of his generation. It is incredibly endearing how much he clearly adores his wife, Tracy. I would have liked there to have been a little more biographical detail of his life and his career after the point he revealed his Parkinson’s diagnosis to the world so as to lessen the impression of a career cut short.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Though covering similar thematic ground around the ethics of eco-terrorism, NIGHT MOVES is both more didactic and more equivocating than PIPELINE. The slow-boiling tension of the first half gives way to a morally uncertain second half with the irritating implication that violence against fossil fuel infrastructure begets and is equivalent to interpersonal violence as if violence against property and violence against people are the same thing. Slow, atmospheric, and thirty minutes too long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Joanna Hogg has a tremendous skill for representing the self-inflicted emotional agonies of the English upper-middle class that others may find self-indulgent but that I find quietly horrifying. Like in the family scenes in &lt;a href=&#34;https://takeonecinema.net/2021/the-souvenir-part-ii/&#34;&gt;THE SOUVENIR films&lt;/a&gt;, Hogg exquisitely captures the details of relationship dynamics within an upper-middle class family who have everything they could want but still manage to be pissy and passive-aggressive about it all. There’s a tension verging into horror in this sense that the English are incapable of happiness and yet cannot acknowledge that or anything but the mildest upsets to the status quo. Hogg captures the horrifying nature of English conservatism: nothing can ever change, nothing will ever change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;David Fincher gets a lot better and a lot more subtle at hiding his disdain for his films’ ‘airport bestseller’ source material. In ALIEN³, he barely disguises his contempt for James Cameron’s ALIENS and we end up with this film’s identity crisis as the narrative is pulled between the horns of ALIEN and ALIENS while tackling heady themes that the film’s grotesque mishmash of a script cannot support. A strong first half sets up some interesting ideas around religious oppression and redemption, toxic masculinity and Christian fundamentalism, and nihilism and suicidal ideation that all collapse in the second half as a shonky action-scene-by-committee extends interminably. A disappointment that collapses under its own thematic weight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Paul T. Goldman, director Jason Woliner unravels the life and works of Paul Finkelman, a delusional but affable man whose experiences of life revolve outwards into bizarre and fantastical pastiches of crime dramas and blockbuster action films. Each plot twist in Finkelman’s amateurish novellas and screenplays makes less sense than the last, building and building to crescendos of joyously unintended absurdity. DO YOU KNOW ME? is like if someone filmed one of Paul T. Goldman’s books as a 100% straight adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The taut script and one-shot cinematography build tension terrifically in the first half. Like Philip Barantini’s BOILING POINT, it feels as if the rooms are filling up with too much gas and will inevitably burst into flames. This rising tension underscores the film’s expression that all of this is important: even a regional hairdressing competition is life or death to the people in it because it matters to them. As Cleve (Clare Perkins) says, they may not have A-Levels but they can cut hair and that makes all their emotion, all their tension, all their rage and all their love justified.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love mountains and have a real weakness for mountaineering documentaries. What distinguishes TOUCHING THE VOID from American-produced documentaries about Nepalese or American mountaineers is its attention to detail and its emotional rawness. This isn’t about what Margaret Grebowicz in &lt;a href=&#34;https://repeaterbooks.com/product/mountains-and-desire-climbing-vs-the-end-of-the-world/&#34;&gt;her excellent cultural critique of mountaineering culture&lt;/a&gt; refers to as “[t]he image of climbing-as-success” naturalising capitalism’s “relentless drive for more”: this is about two men who admit to personal flaws, get annoyed with themselves, admit to irritations with each other even when it deflates the image of the ruggedly determined young (white male) mountaineer. It makes for a more human story than even FREE SOLO.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just fine. A whodunnit murder mystery comedy that doesn’t stand up to recent takes on the genre like KNIVES OUT or SEE HOW THEY RUN but manages to skate along nicely on Jon Hamm’s charm and screen presence. It could definitely have been goofier with its comedy and leaned into Hamm’s comedic skills: he’s long overdue a meaty comedic role and the character of Fletch just isn’t it. The film doesn’t seem to know who it wants Fletch to be or what tone it wants to take so it comes across as toneless. Nice to see Kyle MacLachlan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After ALIEN, ALIENS put the franchise on a path that it didn’t have to take. There was a path available where ALIEN 2 continues with the New Hollywood feel of ALIEN, where it explores the mysterious cosmic Lovecraftian horror of LV-426 and the alien creature, where it leans into the elements that made ALIEN such a masterpiece. Instead, like STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, ALIENS pulls the blossoming franchise into the black hole of blockbuster action films and starts what my co-host Jim Ross refers to as the franchise’s ongoing identity crisis. ALIENS is a very good action movie: solid production design, a terrific screenplay (apart from some corny James Cameron dialogue), and great performances across the board. But I mourn for the ALIEN sequels that we never got because of what this film is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beautifully shot, joyously inventive and subversive, emotionally real. Most importantly, RYE LANE captures the messy energy of South London, a place I called home for the better part of a decade. It’s not just the places in Peckham and Brixton that I walked past a hundred times, it’s the people that the film depicts who all have that ineffable South London quality that makes the place a real community within a metropolis. Capturing that spirit on film is nothing short of incredible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A film where the central thesis—that visual language in cinema, primarily shot composition, both perpetuates and is produced by patriarchal ways of seeing women that contribute to the mainstream cinema industry’s excess of economic discrimination against women and sexual assault against women—is obviously and inarguably true but the presentation of that thesis severely hampers the power of the film. Rather than a recorded lecture, this would work better as a montage piece, allowing the juxtapositions and repeated cinematic structures speak for themselves. There’s a lack of confidence in how the film uses ominous music to direct the audience and several examples are more nuanced than Menkes allows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from GUARDIANS’s focus on the human, the overarching theme of the Guardians films is represented in the moment when Ego (Kurt Russell) tells Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) that while he’s alive Peter is a god and if Peter kills him he’ll be just like everybody else. Peter replies, “What’s so wrong with that?”. It reveals the Guardians films’ existentialist theme of killing your gods—be they Ego, Thanos, the High Evolutionary or anyone else who claims that their act of creation bestows power over you—and embracing your imperfect, broken self. Simon Zek on &lt;a href=&#34;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/plan-75-still-a-michael-j-fox-movie-book-club-the/id1616559297?i=1000612665163&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kermode &amp;amp; Mayo’s Take&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week puts it beautifully by saying that we’re not Avengers, “[i]n fact, we’re all Guardians: a ragtag rabble of misfits and freaks: a broken family with failings and foibles but we all have our place in the family[.]”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One shot that hit me this viewing was the quick shot towards the end of Dey (John C. Reilly) returning home after the obligatory Marvel third act battle to his family, his partner and his daughter. John C. Reilly has about four minutes of screentime in this film and thirty seconds of that is seeing this minor character happy with his family who are alive because of the Guardians. It’s a moment of groundedness among the cosmic that serves as a synecdoche of what James Gunn (and on this first film, Nicole Perlman) achieve with the Guardians of the Galaxy films: a respect for characters, even minor ones, and an emotional understanding of the human (/ Xandarian) concerns behind the smashy-crashy action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My reaction to this film was heavily influenced by the fact I last saw the Guardians characters in the Avengers films where they were done dirty. And so it was very notable to me what a script can do with the characters when the writer/director sincerely engages with them as characters rather than as IP to be smushed together. This direction and emotional sincerity also plays out in the performances and Gunn gets much better performances from Chris Pratt and Dave Bautista than in either of those Avengers films.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quite apart from the blossoming of his distinctive aesthetic (developed in collaboration with his long-time cinematographer Robert Yeoman who rarely gets enough credit for it), RUSHMORE provides early insights into many of the deeper themes and preoccupations that would go on to define Wes Anderson’s work: a focus on class and social status particularly with regards to the hierarchy of positions within esoteric institutions; an eye for the outsider figure and the social outcast; a fascination with under the sea and the life aquatic. A story of a weird little guy told weirdly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An interesting deconstruction of the masculinity inherent to film noir with a cop antagonist who is a bully, a prick, and a rapist presented alongside a be-gay-do-crimes queer femme fatale who is a confident badass and successful novelist. The toxic masculinity and violent machismo of the police as repressive state apparatus is expressed through Nick’s (Michael Douglas) character while Catherine (Sharon Stone) expresses the liberation of queerness, sexual experimentation, and literary creativity. Stone gives a terrific performance in the shadow of Anthony Hopkins’ Hannibal Lecter. The film’s genre subversion is fatally undermined however by a third act where Catherine seems to genuinely fall for this awful man resulting in a hugely disappointing final scene where we see her put down the icepick while in bed with him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And then it’s twenty years later and you’re addicted to your nostalgia. You see ghosts of your own memories from the corner of your eyes on the streets you used to know and the songs you once knew so well are dim echoes that you can’t quite make out. You’re in dialogue with the past version of yourself, you’re a sequel to a person you once were, a person that you hate and love and want to be again and are scared of.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It’s about being young and being addicted to being young and being just old enough to not actually be young anymore. About outgrowing your old friends and making mistakes and being worried that now you’re not young you’re going to be the same sad and broken person for the rest of your life. About being stuck in endlessly repeating patterns and trying desperately to break free while still being who you are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cosmic mix of the dramas of the ‘10s combined with the exploitation films of the ‘70s. There is constant surprise in how layered and postmodern the film is willing to get but it always keeps a sense of playfulness and joy in its use of ‘70s exploitation tropes and metafictional devices right up until the end. Despite its postmodern flourishes, LEONOR WILL NEVER DIE remains grounded through the central focus on its characters and the wonderful sense of coming to know someone through their work and through their love of movies. Almost moves to the beat of jazz.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WET HOT AMERICAN SUMMER works best when it’s leaning into its silliness which unfortunately it doesn’t do frequently enough: the going-to-town montage is great; the subplot with Ken Marino’s character trying to get back to camp is gold. But it often feels like the writers, Michael Showalter and David Wain, don’t quite have the confidence to lean into the absurdist comedy that clearly works best for them (which makes sense because it was earlier in their careers and they probably didn’t). I rolled straight into the prequel series on Netflix which, first impressions, works a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This film deserves the acclaim that ANCHORMAN has for some reason: undeniably up there with THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE! as a perfectly observed absurdist parody of its genre. The hit rate of the gags is incredibly high but I’m especially a sucker for any joke that makes the subtext into text like Joel’s (Paul Rudd) friends who each explicitly represent a distinct point of view on his romantic relationships or how his coffee shop idea is a metaphor for his commitment issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A horny fugue state of a film that adopts the novel’s epistolary format in a way that doesn’t really work on film. Despite that, it’s undeniable how bold the vision is. The sets may look a little ropey but the on-set filming allows Francis Ford Coppola so much control over the composition of shots that he produces some exquisite and singular images. Everything from the camera movements to the costumes to the colours and lighting are so controlled that you can’t help but admire the directorial boldness of more or less every decision. It makes for a camp extravaganza that goes big and encourages every actor in the ensemble to go as big as possible. Plus every film gets a whole extra star when it casts Tom Waits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Loath though I am to suggest that this film should have more THE ROOM-level dialogue or more scenes of hunky shirtless men or more confusingly-staged melodrama or more scenes of the mother (Nicky Whelan) and son (Parker Mack) who look the same age but PRETTY LITTLE STALKERS really needed more establishing scenes for most of its central characters. We’re told that Mark is popular but he really doesn’t come across like that. A romance develops between Mallory (Ashley Rickards) and Mark mostly off-screen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The only Star Trek film to grapple artistically with the unknowability and incomprehensibility of space with a particular focus on conveying the sheer scale of what could be out in the cosmos. It depicts space as inherently hostile with space travel a foolhardy act: basic actions like transporting to a starship or going to warp can result in screaming agonies as our molecules are rearranged or our spacetime is wrenched apart. In stark contrast to STAR WARS released two years prior, this film shows the universe as utterly alien and beyond what human minds can take in. Even our most primitive attempts to reach out into the void of space like the Voyager probes could return with consequences and power that we can scarcely imagine. The only refuge is the sexual act and the emotion of connection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This needed to be a few degrees closer to LIMITLESS on the magic-drug-subgenre spectrum. The core premise is interesting and I liked the film’s allusions to the racial implications of time travel but a film about time travel drugs really doesn’t need to be so dour and so bogged down in character work that really doesn’t add anything narratively or thematically. The first hour is very focused on character crises unrelated to the core premise and it all gets a little ‘&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFBmIwlrPdY&#34;&gt;when are they going to get to the fireworks factory?&lt;/a&gt;’.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A competently-produced Catholic horror film drawing on THE OMEN, THE WICKER MAN, and THE SHINING. There’s a kernel of an interesting idea at the core of the narrative but the script needed at least one more draft and perhaps would have benefitted from leaning into schlocky rather than self-serious. There’s some stunning cinematography benefitting from the natural drama of Skye’s landscape and the use of Christian, specifically Catholic, imagery deepens the film with the weight of Christianity’s inherent horror but it doesn’t feel like it adds up to very much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The superhero movie that Marvel won’t provide: well-lit, practical effects, strongly defined character relationships and romantic entanglements. Seemingly a commentary on a film market saturated with superhero movies: it feels like Quentin Dupieux had to make a superhero movie because nothing else gets made these days and it was the only way he could tell his absurdist stories about fish concerned with water pollution, a helmet that traps you in your thoughts, and a liquified human’s remains in a bucket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mark Cousins’ calm matter-of-fact narration doesn’t impose parallels between Italian fascist propaganda of the 1920s and today’s modern fascist propaganda but instead allows the obvious parallels to speak for themselves. Like Claude Lanzmann, Cousins damns fascists—Trump, Bolsonaro, Le Pen, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2021/oct/23/judith-butler-gender-ideology-backlash&#34;&gt;the UK’s transphobic movement&lt;/a&gt;—by showing the words they have actually said. There’s more than a little liberal equivocation and naïvety in asking what should be done with relics of fascist heritage but the methodical close reading of films like A NOI! (1922, dir. Umberto Paradisi) drew me in as a great example of reading politics from cinema.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ellie Foumbi’s debut feature makes terrific use of light and shadow for its story of trauma, revenge, and forgiveness. Marie (Babetida Sadjo) is haunted by her past trauma and sees it in the face of the new priest, Father Patrick (Souleymane Sy Savane). Father Patrick’s face is hidden for his first few scenes and even after it’s revealed, his face is often shrouded in shadow or emerging out of darkness cultivating an air of menace even as he protests his innocence of the crimes against Marie. As things spiral out of control, it’s Marie’s face that increasingly gets shrouded in darkness as we question whose account is true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Honestly it would work better if I hadn’t seen it at the same festival as &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/therapy_dogs/&#34;&gt;THERAPY DOGS&lt;/a&gt; because the two bear immediate comparison and I LIKE MOVIES comes out worse: both involve aspiring filmmakers in a Canadian high school who are putting together a year-end video and who have an emotional conflict with their one friend and filmmaking partner. I LIKE MOVIES is the parallel universe THERAPY DOGS where it was made as a traditional filmic interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SANCTUARY’s thoughtful depiction of fetish uses the sense of mystery behind sub-dom to bring the audience into the characters’ tangled power dynamics. You’re made part of the role-play because you, like the characters, don’t know what is real and what is erotic play. This wouldn’t work if the film didn’t also make you want Margaret Qualley to step on you. Her expressive face conveys what is otherwise left unsaid while also hiding secrets behind the role-play. The power of her role is in making you fall in love with her while basically learning nothing about her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A mix of THE WICKER MAN and GROUNDHOG DAY that is an interesting blend of genres but adds up to less than the sum of its parts. A community of women refugees living on a small island are treated as non-citizens by the wider world; they are ghosts in the land of the living. Their fragile existence is disrupted when male violence encroaches on their island. STONE TURTLE has a beautifully animated and heartbreaking &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-OeCYaZgT4&#34;&gt;eye-of-the-duck&lt;/a&gt; scene that evokes THE RED TURTLE and holds the key to unlocking the whole film.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An English woman struggles to find the M8 and gradually learns to see Scottish people as human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best representations of the alien and unknown use abstract visual poetry to represent the alien as not only unknown and unknowable but literally inconceivable to us within the bounds that we think in. UNDER THE SKIN excels at this from the opening moments immersing us in eerie conceptual imagery and Mica Levi’s otherworldly but menacing score. I’d never noticed before but there’s slightly disjointed editing in her early interactions with the random Glaswegian men she picks up and it really contributes to the unmoored feeling of that first half.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I hear motorists and politicians complain about Extinction Rebellion or Just Stop Oil blocking roads, I think they ought to be thankful that the activists are engaging in such milquetoast actions. In a just world, their SUVs would be destroyed, fossil fuel extraction and refinement facilities would be expropriated and dismantled, and private planes would be permanently grounded. As Andreas Malm argues in the book that inspires this film, property destruction and sabotage are more than justified at this stage in the climate crisis. A few well-placed drone attacks on the private planes of the most obscenely wealthy and destructive could do wonders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE ORDINARIES’ main character, Paula Feinmann (Fine Sendel), is a Supporting Character. Her father was a Main Character and she studies at the Main Character School to learn how to emote and how to draw the narrative’s attention to herself. It’s a meta conceit that pushes against the limits of cinematic structure in a way similar to Spike Jonze’s ADAPTATION or Charlie Kaufman’s SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK. Like Davey Wreden’s The Stanley Parable, the entire film is a metacommentary where the tension comes from the threat of the narrative collapsing under its own postmodern convolutions. THE ORDINARIES is successful inasmuch as it doesn’t collapse and says something about class and emotional expression even if the pacing falls off towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An England seen through the prism of mental illness might be the truest view of England. TYPIST ARTIST PIRATE KING takes the audience on a psychogeographic journey along the length of England through the eyes of Audrey Amiss (Monica Dolan), a mentally ill British artist whose work was only recognised after her death in 2013. Audrey describes herself as “avant-garde and misunderstood”, a perpetual victim let down by society and those around her. Like TÁR, the world of the film is a reflection of the protagonist’s mental state and we see an England without stability, an England replete with abandoned hospitals and Viking battles and Morris dancers in the street and low-simmering resentments against perceived enemies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A documentary about the theme of failure that abdicates its responsibility to discuss the actual human costs of failure. Stephen Skrynka is a visual artist obsessed with the Wall of Death, a fairground stunt attraction inside which a motorcyclist drives around the walls of a wooden cylinder. Though the documentary focuses on superficial surface level failures—Stephen falling off motorcycles and injuring himself—it fails to adequately explore the emotional and financial costs of the larger failures to the people he’s enlisted to help him achieve his dreams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Ama seeks a world beyond her mother. A tough watch partly because Lukumuena’s striking performance was triggeringly accurate for me in her depiction of panic attacks. A beautiful film that shows an unbeautiful world: the lighting of Black skin was particularly impressive and effective in letting the actors express themselves through subtle gestures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

POLITE SOCIETY is a modern Jane Austen story that combines wuxia films like CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON with comic-book style films like SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD all in service of a story that speaks to how modern British-Pakistani women approach practices like arranged marriage and how the generational trauma of second-generation immigrants continues to filter down to their children. Outstanding supporting turns from Ella Bruccoleri, Seraphina Beh, and Nimra Bucha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Šarlota (Natália Germáni) returns to the mountain village where she grew up to find she’s an object of suspicion to the villagers. The gradual influx of horror elements and the dreamy expressionistic cinematography of the lush European forest are similar to David Bruckner’s THE RITUAL but where that film dealt with manhood and toxic masculinity, NIGHTSIREN centres on womanhood and explores social sexual norms in Eastern Europe. Is Šarlota a witch or an urban, educated, sexually-liberated woman? Proving that folk horror isn’t an exclusively English subgenre, NIGHTSIREN uses folk traditions and symbolism in service of its exploration of the societal misogyny buried just beneath the surface of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Like BRIAN AND CHARLES or A BUNCH OF AMATEURS, there’s a charm in seeing the film’s amateur rocket scientists building a rocket out of scraps in a farmhouse. There’s an accompanying sense of power and liberation too: why should space travel be the province solely of nation states or major corporations? Why couldn’t we open source space travel and open up the Earth’s gravitational prison for anyone and everyone with the will to escape it? A gentle film with a climax that makes the journey worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;High school is a shared nightmare. A unique subculture that most of us experienced but which we’ve forgotten the intensity of. Ethan Eng’s debut feature captures the anarchic chaos of the high school experience with a dizzying montage of styles, tones, and genres while also representing the deep emotional lows of separating from friends and the feeling that, after high school, life as you know it will be over. Astonishingly inventive Gen Z filmmaking proving the next generation will be better than mine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The eventual feature film turns out to be a marvel of technically complex stop-motion animation which also captures something poignant about loss, trauma, dementia, and ageing.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD is to thirty-somethings what OTHER PEOPLE’S CHILDREN is to forty-somethings: a mature emotionally resonant romantic comedy-drama that embraces the complexity of modern relationships. Since I’m closer to forty than thirty, I was more affected by this film about a childless adult navigating relationships with other people’s children while conflicted about their own potential for parenthood than the former. It’s honestly refreshing to see a romantic comedy that straightforwardly deals with adulthood, sexuality, and parenthood with far more emotional maturity than any Hollywood romcom. Get the ‘unnecessary sex scene’ discourse people to watch this and have their heads explode.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cosmic event strikes the lake where two brothers are swimming, mutilating one and dooming his chances of taking part in Europe’s first space colonisation mission. TROPIC is an intriguing blend of genres that talks about humanity and what it means to accept or abandon what cannot be changed. The film has a slow weirdness that evokes Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s MEMORIA and alludes to John Carpenter’s sci-fi horror of the ‘80s. TROPIC presents an interesting metaphor for what space colonisation would mean for the planet but could benefit from tighter editing to resolve some structural issues and a little more time spent on ancillary plotlines to build them up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a huge generational divide between baby boomers who are rich in capital but emotionally immature and millennials who are poor but emotionally fortified by multiple recessions and 21st century uncertainty. ADOPTING AUDREY examines the gap between the generations and mines what shared emotions can be found there. Jena Malone is terrific as a socially atomised millennial striving for community and a sense of what home might be while Robert Hunger-Bühler is very funny as a cold Herzogian boomer parent who can’t connect with his children despite his growing regrets in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A palette of greys and browns that makes the splashes of colour representing objects and beings from beyond the boundary limits of human imagination all the more shocking. Political and military authorities mentally incapable of comprehending information that damages their ultimately fragile worldviews. A population of ordinary people filled with ancestral race memories of the supposedly genetically superior ritualistically slaughtering their inferiors. So, quintessentially British.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Kiefer Sutherland’s character says to Amy Smart’s character “Hey cis”, the film is unlocked as a trans allegory. Sutherland plays a trans man evidenced by his continual taking of pills and his recent alienation from former friends who seemingly can’t accept who he is. His obsession with mirrors is a reflection (!) of his anxiety about his appearance post-transition. Ultimately Sutherland accepts himself by metaphorically killing the oppressive Catholic Church and literally fighting the demon in the mirror. He realises that it is not himself but the world that needs to change: the whole world appears backwards to him at the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cautionary tale about moving to a community that you know nothing about, buying someone’s foreclosed home, stealing or selling all the stuff that they left, using their personal effects and family photos to start making a documentary film about them without their consent, and recording their vulnerable father in a convalescent home without his permission. Absurdly bad pacing that becomes clearest in the final act when you see how much exposition they suddenly need to do around elements that should have been introduced in the first act. For example, the Devil’s Throat, a pit in the woods (that apparently has its own sign?) that comes out of nowhere to be highly significant. Nice to see Juliette Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An England riven by political division turns to superstitious persecution of people for the sadistic thrill of victimising an out-group. A charismatic leader makes money off his sadistic prejudice while commanding those less educated than him to bully, torture, and kill women. All the more horrific for taking place in broad daylight under the cloudy sky of a perpetually autumnal England with winter fast approaching. The least successful of the Unholy Trinity of British folk horror, for my money, despite its horror feeling more tangible and immediate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like the film’s wyrd combination of paganism and Christianity, it’s the combination of elements that elevates this early entry into what we’d now call the folk horror subgenre. Aside from the striking French location, the British production mixes in other elements of French filmmaking from the time with editing and dynamic cinematography evocative of the Surrealists and a beguilingly erotic performance from Sharon Tate. The Francophone elements combine with a British horror of the rural and distrust of Roman Catholicism to create a fascinating mood that Robin Hardy would build upon to make THE WICKER MAN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I watch this every year around this date and I would do so even if it were nothing but Maya Rudolph’s ‘Key Change’ song. It’s interesting how it showcases the different comedy and performance styles of the various UCB-style comedians involved even as it feels distinctly like The Lonely Island and Comedy Bang Bang.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Albert Brooks’ early satire of reality television is almost too dry for its own good with a lot of the best parts carried entirely by Brooks’ delivery. This is a blessing and a curse since it pushes Brooks to carry the film himself (albeit as the worst kind of twat) rather than having confidence in his premise and its comedic potential. Nonetheless it’s very clever and very funny with incredibly sharp writing that really sticks with you. Without this, you don’t get other postmodern takes on reality TV like Peter Weir’s THE TRUMAN SHOW or Nathan Fielder’s The Rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An adaptation less confident in its source material might have focused on what comes before and what happens after but WOMEN TALKING focuses in on the crux, the critical moments of decision that determine the fate of these women, their community, their families, and their religion. In so doing, the colony becomes a synecdoche for patriarchal society and their decision reflects the myriad of difficult decisions women need to make to survive and keep themselves safe. Excellent performances from Claire Foy and Jessie Buckley bring the film’s stagier aspects to life and an astonishing score by Hildur Guðnadóttir fills the silence between the talking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What’s it called? Cumbernauld! Bill Forsyth has an incredible ability to draw a whole character in only a few brush strokes. The world of the film feels so fully realised, aided by genuinely hilarious background visual gags like the boys’ toilets as some kind of speakeasy and the hapless high jumper. There’s a charming awkwardness about not only the lead performances but the whole atmosphere of the film that makes it feel authentically teenage despite the somewhat heightened world. Not up to the level of LOCAL HERO but not far off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame that this is so clearly made as a (apologies) copycat of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS since it actually has some interesting things to say about the influence of true crime on its audience and about &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448221138768&#34;&gt;serial killer fandom&lt;/a&gt; and it’s a shame a lot of that is watered down by the film’s adherence to the structure and tone of its predecessor. We’ve been relaxing on weekends by watching mid-budget ‘90s thrillers and it’s noticeable how much more consideration even the most disposable of them give to shot composition, scene lighting, and camera movements than a lot of ultra-high-budget franchise blockbusters today. Unsurprising to learn that the Director of Photography was the great László Kovács.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You wonder why they kept this title until you hear the screenplay’s idea of dialogue. For a film about time travel shenanigans, it’s ploddingly leaden and self-serious all the way through with dialogue either being outright expository or sour-faced portentousness (apart from the protagonist’s sister who actually speaks quite naturally usually about her quote best friend unquote). Considering how central it is to the plot, the depiction of time travel and memory retention didn’t seem coherent: if they could remember things temporarily after a timeshift, why not just write down what they remember right then before they forgot? What was with the time-proof servers for storing jpegs? What is a timestack?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was at school, a teacher wrote the word ‘prat’ on a pupil’s forehead in permanent marker. I wasn’t in the class where this happened but it became legend throughout the school, passed on through gossip in the corridors and the schoolyard. Such mythic status was leant to this story that to this day I can remember the name of the teacher and the name of the pupil. MY OLD SCHOOL works by tapping into the gossipy but friendly tone of old classmates reminiscing at a school reunion about those high school events that seemed so significant but no-one remembers with 100% clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Still looks incredible: not just the mixing of animation and live-action elements but the period 1940s LA production design and the animation itself. It’s an ode to a period of animation before Pixarification flattened the goal of animation into verisimilitude and realistic physics. Here there’s cartoon physics, distortion of space and time, quasi-Surrealist visuals and it all looks terrifically dynamic especially in the opening Baby Herman cartoon. All the actors are smashing it, particularly Bob Hoskins and Charles Fleischer as Roger Rabbit. Simply the best film about how the corrupt judicial systems of the United States deliberately undermine and destroy reliable public transportation systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No horror film builds dread in quite the same way as idly noticing from a date in a brief shot that this film starts in 2019. For most of the documentary, Covid-19 looms on the horizon, surely portending doom for this small movie-making club and its eccentric, mostly elderly, members. This bittersweet sense of steadfastly continuing to do what you love infuses the documentary and portrays the intense meaningfulness of this small club to its members (similar to Detectorists). A charming portrait of the importance of artistic expression outside of the usual cultural centres.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An exploration not just of the Sackler family and their role in the opioid crisis and the art world but of how alternative communities live, thrive, and survive. The film uses Nan Goldin’s work and her life as exemplars of alternative communities—queer communities, sex worker communities, activist communities—and shows the importance of friendship groups and artistic communities as alternatives to the suburban American family. Laura Poitras skilfully weaves together the threads of Goldin’s life, work, and activism towards a conclusion that just falls short of pointing at the nuclear family as a specific locus of structural oppression but very clearly gestures in that direction. Whether Sackler or Goldin, the family controls and suppresses ways of being and gets away with murder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“And there’s this feeling, once you leave where you grew up, that you don’t totally belong there again.” When I was a kid in the ‘90s, we&amp;rsquo;d go on family holidays to resorts in places like Majorca and Malta. But as I got older, I didn&amp;rsquo;t like heat and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like suncream and all the family time felt claustrophobic. It&amp;rsquo;s on these holidays that you start to realise your own preferences and start the painful process of becoming your own person. But also Dad would hold my hand and I’d walk along a small wall and we&amp;rsquo;d sing Walking On Sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PRIMAL FEAR contains some of the understated hallmarks of ‘90s thrillers: an obsession with property development; corruption that goes up to the highest levels of local government; questionable treatment of mental health issues; women that exist only in the orbit of men. The cast appears absolutely stacked from a current perspective but this is primarily because of how successful several of them became years after filming this like Frances McDormand (FARGO came out one month before this), Andre Braugher, and Terry O’Quinn. Richard Gere leads doing his same old Richard Gere-thing but the real draw is a stellar performance from Edward Norton in his first film role who is so good here that it seems like a shame he couldn’t play Brad Pitt’s role in FIGHT CLUB alongside himself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A West German B-movie horror, the best part of which is the interesting production design from the paintings influenced by Hieronymous Bosch to the locations evocative of Dark Souls. ‘The Deserted Forest’ where the trees have human limbs extending from them could be straight out of a FromSoftware game. The original German title, ‘The Snake Pit and the Pendulum’, is much better but puts a lot of pressure on the third act’s setpieces which take up respectively two minutes and six minutes of movie time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiet devastation erupts in discrete moments of an otherwise drawn-out trial. Alice Diop shows the processes of institutional justice in all their long, slow, and wordy reality with long shots on one person talking, defending herself, and repeating her life story for the court. But like being on an actual jury, being in court is more boring than you might imagine. It feels like the documentary form might have been better for this kind of exploration of structural racism, France’s treatment of African immigrants, and challenging preconceptions. That said, there are moments of emotion that burst through the trudge of a jury trial: when two Black women share a glance and a smile in the midst of everything. Maybe that’s the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days, a huge amount of money would be spent on special effects to make the boat chase actually look like it’s taking place in Venice. Steven Spielberg correctly intuits that it’s enough for an audience to watch boats going fast and makes no attempt to disguise the dockyard (presumably in California) where it’s actually filmed. Such is the strength of Sean Connery’s performance as Henry Jones Sr. that as a kid I thought every third film in a series should introduce the main character’s parents. Perhaps one too many action scenes for me these days but the three trials before the Grail are really tense and masterfully edited. Spielberg is such a safe pair of hands as a blockbuster director that it’s a real comfort watch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cate Blanchett plays Lydia Tár as a charming, authoritative, magnetic, and terrible person. We’re fully immersed in the life and perspective of a deeply unpleasant person and there’s a complex catharsis as the film charts her downfall. Todd Field makes us feel not sympathy but maybe empathy for Tár even as we’re disgusted by her many abusive actions. Cinema at its best encourages us to explore complex and complicated feelings and TÁR is at once delicate, considered, and forceful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A 1970s BBC British horror that has fallen through time to be released in 2023. The Volunteer (Mary Woodvine) undertakes the same ritual each and every day and it gradually becomes clear that she’s not a botanist but something deeper—something older—and that the flower she’s protecting is something more. ENYS MEN shows an England where nothing changes to such an extent that time starts flowing backwards and overlapping with itself. Memories, people, places, and objects all merge into one as the relentlessness of conservatism flattens everything into the same person, the same flower, the same menhir.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EO directed by Jerzy Skolimowski uses the language of cinema to push us to empathise with a non-human protagonist and therefore expand our sense of subjectivity to cover the perspective of its titular donkey. Without dialogue and with an incredible soundscape, EO follows a circus donkey as he encounters other animals and wanders through the ruins and conflicts of modern European history. Like Kossakovsky’s GUNDA and Arnold’s COW, EO pushes us to consider the exploitation of animals and the subjectivity of the others on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A post-apocalyptic period piece filmed in the context of the nuclear annihilation of two cities and 220,000 people, RASHOMON strips down humanity until it finds cynicism, deceit, selfishness, and despair. With no truth, there can be no agreement and no reconciliation or forgiveness even after the body’s death. It’s a bleak, empty, and egotistic world where everyone is out only for themselves. Until, that is, a baby cries and hope is found in the simple act of kindness to the generation who can rebuild this shattered world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you set out to purposefully miscast a film, you couldn’t do a better job than THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES did inadvertently. Tom Hanks is too inherently likeable to be the racist Wall Street guy callously throwing other people to the wolves; Bruce Willis is too self-serious to be the drunken journalist accidentally ruining lives; Kim Cattrall and Melanie Griffith are in entirely different movies. The tone is all over the place and doesn’t succeed in telling the story of racism and social stratification that it’s trying to tell. Like HEARTS OF DARKNESS and APOCALYPSE NOW, the making of the film (in the form of Julie Salamon’s book The Devil’s Candy) is more interesting than the film itself. Too inept to even be fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A great performance from Jane Fonda as a sex worker whose reward for navigating a paranoid world of shadowy figures and sexual assault is to end up with John Klute (Donald Sutherland), the most boring man alive. Alan J. Pakula excels at capturing the dark grime of 1970s Manhattan and the paranoid state of America at the time. Fonda carries the film with a humanising portrayal of a woman traumatised by men’s violence and unashamed of her profession. It’s just such a shame that Sutherland’s character is the basis for the title and yet his character is so bland: he’s also the same age as me currently in this but looks ten years older.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS feels like a play in that it’s carried by its terrific dialogue and performances. This is a man’s world (perhaps only one woman in the background in the Chinese restaurant) with all the toxicity and grime that that implies. These are Masters of the Universe in miniature: men who were raised to rule the world reduced to resetting their personalities wholesale to sell property deals that no-one needs and, since this is the only masculine satisfaction they can achieve, their whole world has been reduced to the game of lying and selling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
