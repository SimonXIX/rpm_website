An astonishing physical performance from Ben Foster drives this thriller where the villain is not a serial killer but road infrastructure and careless rural driving practices. Ben Foster is a charming, creepy, unreadable quiet little man whose obsession drives away his hot wife (played by Cobie Smulders who manages to do enough with the very little character that the screenplay gives). Fosterâ€™s secret seems to be bringing a little Tim Robinson energy to the role in a way that makes the script pop while also tapping into the deep pathos of the character and further establishes *I Think You Should Leave* as the key text of our current sociocultural moment.
