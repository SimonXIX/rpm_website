I was extremely concerned that this documentary on the rise of American neo-fascism would sympathise with the three Proud Boys that it follows but was pleased to see that director Michael Premo’s detached style of documentary filmmaking simply observes the men exposing themselves as mendacious, stupid, incoherent, and selfish without particularly expecting the audience to care about their racist and bigoted concerns. These are men obsessed with their warped ideas of freedom and capitalism who like to indulge in the casual cruelty of threatening to crucify an “Antifa” protester or dumping gallons of paint on Black Lives Matter protesters. Living in 2025, it unfortunately feels like half a story.
