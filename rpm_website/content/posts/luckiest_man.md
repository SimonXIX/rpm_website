An entertainingly tense dramatisation of a small-scale situation on a 1980s US game show. THE LUCKIEST MAN IN AMERICA has some fun nostalgia aesthetics emulating the look of old VHS recordings (it specifically brought to mind Patrick Cotnoir’s visual work on [this live reading of THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0Bslw2hLzI)). Paul Walter Hauser carries the film with a wonderfully ambiguous charm where you never quite know if he’s a charming happy-go-lucky guy or a snake oil salesman. Patti Harrison is sadly wasted but it’s always a joy to see her.
