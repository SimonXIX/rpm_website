The premise of becoming lost in an infinite hotel filled with eccentric inhabitants with clear inspiration from Kafka, BARTON FINK, *House of Leaves*, and *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland* sounded like catnip to me. Disappointingly there’s not much more substance to MR. K beneath the web of allusions and references. There’s a terrifically blank performance from Crispin Glover playing the straight man and some terrific Jeunet and Andersson inspired production design and visual style but it doesn’t add up to much. A wonderfully strange and cosmic ending went some way to redeeming the whole however.
