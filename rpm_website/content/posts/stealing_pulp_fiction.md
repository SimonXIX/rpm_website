That rarest of things for me: a legitimately funny comedy movie. There’s just the right balance of snappy dialogue, colourful characters, postmodern references, and absurdism. In expanding from his original short film, Danny Turkiewicz wisely recognises that this comedy doesn’t need the addition of big emotional arcs but just needs to be more. All you need to know is that it made me laugh after a busy day and one Jason Alexander bit about pickles had me crying.
